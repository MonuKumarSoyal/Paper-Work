My dear countrymen
Namaskar.
With new topics
with new inspirational examples
gathering new messages
I have come once again to express 'Mann Ki Baat' with you
Do you know about which topic I have received the maximum letters
messages this time? This subject is such that it is connected to past
present
future; all three
I am talking about the country’s new Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya
On this 14th April
the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar
the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya was dedicated to the nation
It has been opened for the citizens of the country
One such listener is Shrimaan Sarthak ji; Sarthak ji lives in Gurugram
has visited the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya at the very first opportunity
The message that Sarthak ji has written to me on Namo App is very interesting
He has written that for years he has been watching news channels
reading newspapers
along with being connected to social media
so he used to think that his general knowledge was good enough… but
when he visited the PM Museum
he was very surprised
he realized that he did not know much about his country
those who led the country
He has written about certain facets of the PM Museum which heightened his curiosity such as the spinning wheel of Lal Bahadur Shastri
gifted to him by his in-laws
that made Sarthak ji happy
He also saw Shastri ji's passbook noticing how little savings he had
Sarthak ji has written that he did not even know that Morarji Bhai Desai was Deputy Collector in Gujarat before joining the freedom struggle
He had a long career in the administrative service
On Chaudhary Charan Singh ji
Sarthak ji writes that he was unaware of Chaudhary Charan Singh ji’s great contribution in the field of zamindari abolition
Not just that
he further writes he saw that Mr
P.V
Narasimha Rao ji took a very keen interest in the work of Land Reform
Sarthak ji also came to know only after coming to this museum that Chandrashekhar ji had undertaken the historic Bharat Yatra
walking more than 4 thousand kilometers
In the museum
when he saw the items that Atalji used
listened to his speeches
he was filled with pride
Sarthak ji also mentioned that this museum also provides very interesting information about Mahatma Gandhi
Sardar Patel
Dr
Ambedkar
Jai Prakash Narayan
our Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Friends
what can be a better time to remember the contribution of the Prime Ministers of the country than the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav? It is a matter of pride for the country that the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement
People's interest in history is increasing a lot
in such a situation the PM Museum is also becoming a centre of attraction for the youth
connecting them with the precious heritage of the country.
By the way
friends
when so much is being discussed with you about the museum
I felt that I should also ask you some questions
Let's see what your general knowledge says… how much information you have! Are you ready
my young friends
are you ready with your paper
pen? What I am going to ask you right now
you can share the answers on NaMo App or social media with #MuseumQuiz…
do share
I urge you to answer all these questions
This will enhance interest in the museum among people all over the country
Do you know in which city of the country there is a famous Rail Museum where people have been getting a chance to see the heritage of Indian Railways for the last 45 years? Let me give you another clue
You can also find here
from the Fairy Queen
the Saloon of Prince of Wales to the Fireless Steam Locomotive
Do you know which museum is there in Mumbai
where we get to see the evolution of currency in a very interesting way? Here coins of the sixth century BC are present; on the other hand
e-Money is also present
The third question - 'Virasat-e-Khalsa' is related to this museum
Do you know
in which city of Punjab is this museum located? All of you must be enjoying a lot in kite flying; the next question is related to this
Where is the country's one
only Kite Museum? Let me give you a clue
the biggest kite displayed here is 22 by 16 feet in size
Did something come to mind – No? Let me tell you one more thing here - the city in which it is located has a special connection with Bapu
Who does not have the hobby of collecting postage stamps in childhood! But
do you know where the National Museum related to postage stamps is in India? I ask you one more question
Which museum is housed in a building named Gulshan Mahal? The clue for you is that in this museum you can also become the director of a film
you can also see the nuances of camera
editing
Ok
do you know of any museum that celebrates India's textile heritage? This museum has miniature paintings
Jaina manuscripts
sculptures -…many more
It is also known for its unique display.
Friends
in this era of technology
it is very easy for you to find answers to these
I asked these questions so that the curiosity in our new generation rises… they read more about them; go
visit them
Now
because of the importance of museums
many people themselves are coming forward
donating a lot to the museums
Many people are donating their old collections
as well as historical artefacts
to museums
When you do this
in a way
you share a cultural treasure with the entire society
In India too
people are now coming forward for this
I also appreciate all such individual efforts
Today
in the changing times
due to the covid protocols
emphasis is being placed on adopting new methods in museums
The focus has also increased on digitization in museums
You must be aware that on the 18th of May International Museum Day will be celebrated all over the world
In view of this
I have an idea for my young friends
Why not visit a local museum with your circle of friends during the upcoming holidays
Do share your experience with #MuseumMemories
By doing so you will also awaken curiosity about museums in the minds of others.
My dear countrymen
you must be taking many resolves in your life
and be you must be working hard to fulfill them
Friends
recently
I came to know about such a resolve
which was really different
very unique
That's why I thought that I must share it with the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat'.
Friends
can you imagine that someone could come out of one’s house with a resolve that one would roam the whole city for the whole day without doing any money transaction in cash – isn’t this an interesting resolve
Two daughters of Delhi
Sagarika
Preksha
experimented with Cashless Day Out like this
Wherever Sagarika
Preksha went in Delhi
they got the facility of digital payment
Because of the UPI QR code
they did not have to withdraw cash
Even at most of the street food
roadside vendors they got the facility of online transaction.
Friends
one may think that it is Delhi
a metro city
it is easy to have all this here
But now it is not the case that this spread of UPI is limited only to big cities like Delhi
I have also received a message from Anandita Tripathi from Ghaziabad
Anandita had gone to the North East with her husband last week
She narrated me the experience of her journey from Assam to Meghalaya
Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh
You will also be pleasantly surprised to know that in this journey of spanning several days
they did not need to withdraw cash even in remote areas
In places where there was no good internet facility till a few years ago
now there is also the facility of payment through UPI
Looking at the experiences of Sagarika
Preksha
Anandita
I would also urge you to try the experiment of Cashless Day Out
definitely do it.
Friends
in the last few years
BHIM UPI has rapidly become a part of our economy
habits
Now
even in small towns
in most villages people are transacting through UPI itself
A culture is also evolving in the country throughS Digital Economy
In the small street shops digital payment has made it easy to serve more
more customers
Now they don't even have a problem of loose change
You must also feel the convenience of UPI in everyday life
Wherever you go… carrying cash
going to the bank
finding an ATM… the hassle is now over
All payments are made from mobile itself
but
have you ever thought that how big a digital economy has been created in the country due to these small online payments of yours
At present
transactions worth about 20 thousand crore rupees are taking place in our country every day
Last March
UPI transactions reached around Rs 10 lakh crores
Due to this
convenience is also increasing in the country
an atmosphere of honesty is also being created
Now many new start-ups related to Fin-tech are also coming up in the country
I would like you to share any experiences related to this power of digital payment
start-up ecosystem
Your experiences can become an inspiration to many other countrymen.
My dear countrymen
how the power of technology is changing the lives of ordinary people
we are constantly seeing this around us
Technology has done another great job
It has served to bring the benefit of the extraordinary abilities of the Divyang friends to the country
the world
At the Tokyo Paralympics we have seen what our Divyang brothers
sisters can achieve
Just like in sports
in arts
academics
many other fields
Divyang friends are doing wonders
but when these friends get the power of technology
they achieve even greater heights
That is why
the country is constantly making efforts to make the resources
infrastructure accessible to the differently-abled
There are also many start-ups
organizations in the country which are doing inspirational work in this direction
There is one such organization – Voice of Specially Abled People
this organization is promoting new opportunities in the field of assistive technology
An innovative beginning has also been made to take the work of Divyang artists to the world
Voice of Specially Abled People has prepared a digital art gallery of paintings of these artists
How Divyang friends are rich in extraordinary talents
what extraordinary abilities they have - this art gallery is an example of that
What are the challenges in the life of Divyang friends
how far can they reach after overcoming them? You can feel many such facets in these paintings
If you also know a Divyang friend
know their talent
then with the help of digital technology
you can bring them to the fore in front of the world
Divyang friends must also join such endeavours.
My dear countrymen
summer heat is increasing very fast in most parts of the country
This rising heat equally increases our responsibility to save water
It is possible that there may be plenty of water available where you are now
But
you also have to always remember the crores of people who live in water-stressed areas
for whom every drop of water is like elixir.
Friends
at this time in the 75th year of independence
in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav
water conservation is one of the resolves with which the country is moving forward
During the Amrit Mahotsav
75 Amrit Sarovars will be built in every district of the country
You can imagine how big the campaign is
The day is not far when there will be 75 Amrit Sarovars in your own city
I would like all of you
and especially the youth
to know about this campaign
also bear responsibility for it
If there is any history related to freedom struggle in your area
if there is a memory of a freedom fighter
you can also connect it with Amrit Sarovar
By the way
I like to learn that after taking the resolve of Amrit Sarovar
work has started on it at many places at a rapid pace
I have come to know about Gram Panchayat Patwai of Rampur in UP
There was a pond on the land of the Gram Sabha
but it was full of filth
heaps of garbage
With a lot of hard work
with the help of local people
with the help of local school children
that dirty pond has been transformed in the last few weeks
Now
many arrangements have been made on the banks of that lake like retaining wall
boundary wall
food court
fountains
lighting
I congratulate the Patwai Gram Panchayat of Rampur
the people of the village
the children there for this effort.
Friends
the availability of water
the scarcity of water
these determine the progress
speed of any country
You must have also noticed that in 'Mann Ki Baat'
I do talk about water conservation again
again along with topics like cleanliness
It is clearly stated in our scriptures –
Paniyam paramam loke
jeevaanaam jeevanam samritam ||
That is
in the world
water is the basis of life of every living being
water is also the biggest resource
that is why our ancestors gave so much emphasis on water conservation
From Vedas to Puranas
to save water everywhere
to build ponds
lakes etc.
has been termed as the social
spiritual duty of a person
In Valmiki Ramayana
special emphasis has been laid on water conservation
on connecting water sources
Similarly
students of history would know
how much engineering was developed in India regarding water even during the Indus-Saraswati
Harappan civilizations
In ancient times
there was an interconnected system of water sources in many cities
this was the time
when the population was not that much
there was no shortage of natural resources
there was a kind of abundance
yet
about water conservation the awareness was very high then,
But
today the situation is reverse
I urge all of you to know about such old ponds
wells
lakes in your area
Due to the Amrit Sarovar Abhiyan
along with water conservation
a distinct identity of your area will also develop
With this
local tourist places will also be developed in cities
localities
people will also get a place to walk around.
Friends
every effort related to water is related to our tomorrow
It is the responsibility of the whole society
For this
different societies have made various efforts continuously for centuries
For example
'Maldhari'
a tribe of "Rann of Kutch" uses a method called "Vridas" for water conservation
Under this
small wells are built
trees
plants are planted nearby to protect it
Similarly
the Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh used their historical tradition "Halma" for water conservation
Under this tradition
the people of this tribe gather at one place to find a solution to the problems related to water
Due to the suggestions received from the Halma tradition
the water crisis in this area has reduced
the ground water level is also increasing.
Friends
if the same sense of duty comes in everyone's mind
the biggest of challenges related to water crisis can be solved
Come
let us take a pledge to conserve water
save life in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav of freedom
We will save water drop by drop
save every single life.
My dear countrymen
you must have seen that a few days ago I held 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' with my young friends
students
During this discussion some students said that they are afraid of maths in the exam
A similar thought was also sent to me by many students in their messages
At that very moment I had decided that I would definitely discuss mathematics this time in 'Mann Ki Baat'
Friends
Mathematics is such a subject about which we Indians should be most comfortable
After all
the people of India have given the most research
contribution to the whole world regarding mathematics
You must have heard a lot about zero
that is
the discovery of zero
its importance
Often you will also hear that if zero was not discovered
then perhaps we would not have been able to see so much scientific progress in the world
From Calculus to Computers - all these scientific inventions are based on Zero
Mathematicians
scholars of India have even written that –
यत किंचित वस्तु तत सर्वं
गणितेन बिना नहि !
That is
whatever is there in this entire universe
everything is based on mathematics
If you remember the study of science
you will understand its meaning
Every principle of science is expressed through a mathematical formula
Be it Newton's laws
Einstein's famous equation
all the science related to the universe is mathematics
Now scientists also discuss Theory of Everything
that is
a single formula that can express everything in the universe
Our sages have always imagined such an expansion of scientific understanding with the help of mathematics
If we invented zero
we have also expressed infinityas well
In common parlance
when we talk about numbers
numbers
we speak
think till million
billion
trillion
but
in Vedas
in Indian mathematics
this calculation goes much further
We have a very old verse here -
एकं दशं शतं चैव
सहस्रम् अयुतं तथा |
लक्षं च नियुतं चैव
कोटि: अर्बुदम् एव च ||
वृन्दं खर्वो निखर्व: च
शंख: पद्म: च सागर: |
अन्त्यं मध्यं परार्ध: च
दश वृद्ध्या यथा क्रमम् ||
The order of numbers is given in this verse
such as -
One
ten
hundred
thousand
ayut!
Lakh
Niyut
Koti i.e
crores.
Similarly this number goes up to the shankh
padma
saagar
One saagar means 10 to the power of 57
Not only this
there are numbers like Ogh
Mahog even after this
There is a Mahogha –10 to the power of 62
that is
62 zeros next to one
Even if we imagine such a large number in the mind
it is difficult
but
in Indian mathematics
they have been used for thousands of years
Just a few days ago I met the CEO of Intel company
He had given me a painting
in which one such Indian method of calculation or measurement was depicted through Vamana avatar
With reference to the name Intel
the computer would have come automatically to your mind
You must have also heard about the binary system in the language of computer
but
Do you know that in our country there were sages like Acharya Pingala
who postulated the binary
Similarly
from mathematicians Aryabhatta to Ramanujan
there has been work on many principles of mathematics here.
Friends
Mathematics has never been a difficult subject for us Indians
a big reason for this is our Vedic Mathematics
The credit of Vedic mathematics in modern times goes to Shri Bharati Krishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj
He revived the ancient methods of calculation
named it Vedic Mathematics
The most important thing about Vedic Mathematics was that through it you can do even the most difficult calculations in your mind in the blink of an eye
You must have seen videos of many such youths learning
teaching Vedic maths on social media these days.
Friends
today in 'Mann Ki Baat' a similar friend who teaches Vedic Mathematics is also joining us
This is Gaurav Tekriwal ji of Kolkata
And for the last two-and-a-half decades
he has been taking this movement of Vedic mathematics forward with great dedication
Come
let's talk to him.
Modi ji - Gaurav ji Namaste!
Gaurav – Namaste sir!
Modi ji - I have heard that you are very interested in Vedic Maths; you do a lot
So
first I would like to know something about you
later
how you are interested in this subject
do tell me?
Gaurav - Sir
when I was applying for business school twenty years ago
it used to have a competitive exam called CAT
There were many maths questions in it
which had to be done in little time
So
my mother brought me a book called Vedic Mathematics
Swami Shri Bharatikrishna Tirtha Ji Maharaj had written that book
And in that he gave 16 sutras
In which mathematics used to be very simple
very fast
When I read that
I was very inspired
then my interest was awakened in Mathematics
I understood that this subject
which is a gift of India
which is our heritage
can be taken to every corner of the world
Since then I made it a mission to take Vedic Mathematics to every nook
corner of the world
Because the fear of mathematics haunts everyone
And what can be simpler than Vedic Mathematics!
Modi ji - Gaurav ji for how many years have you been working in this?
Gaurav – It has been almost 20 years sir
I am still at it.
Modi ji - And what do you do for awareness
what experiments do you use
how do you reach people?
Gaurav - We go to schools
we give online education
The name of our organization is Vedic Maths Forum India
Under that organization
we teach Vedic Maths 24 hours a day through the internet
Sir!
Modi ji - Gaurav ji
you know
I also like to interact with children constantly
I keep looking for opportunities
And with exam warrior
I have institutionalized it in a way
I have also experienced that when I talk to children
they run away as soon as they hear the name of maths
And so
my effort is that this fear which is without any reason should be removed
this fear should be removed with basic techniques of mathematics which come from our traditions
which are not new to India
Perhaps
among the ancient traditions in the world India has a tradition of mathematics
So if the exam warrior’s fear has to be dispelled
what will you advise them?
Gaurav - Sir
this is most useful for children
because
the fear of exams which has become a fobia in every home
Children take tuition for the exam
parents are worried
Teachers also get upset
So all this gets dissipates with Vedic maths
Vedic maths is fifteen hundred percent faster than this simple maths
it gives a lot of confidence in the children
the mind also runs faster
As such
we have also introduced Yoga with Vedic Mathematics
So that if the children want
they can calculate even with their eyes closed by the method of Vedic mathematics.
Modi ji - Even in the tradition of dhyan
doing mathematics in this way is also a primary course of meditation.
Gaurav - Right Sir!
Modi ji - Well Gaurav ji
it is very nice that you
I have taken up this work in mission mode
especially your mother took you on this path as a good guru
And today you are taking millions of children on that path
My best wishes to you
Gaurav - Thank you sir! I thank you sir! That you gave importance to Vedic maths
chose me sir! So we are very thankful.
Modi ji - Thank you very much
Namaskar.
Gaurav - Namaste sir.
Friends
Gaurav ji has very well explained how Vedic maths can transform mathematics from complex to fun
Not only this
you can also solve big scientific problems with Vedic mathematics
I would like all parents to teach Vedic maths to their children
With this
their confidence will not only increase; the analytical power of their brain will also increase
yes
whatever little fear some children have about Mathematics
that phobia will also end completely.
My dear countrymen
today in 'Mann Ki Baat'
many informative topics from museum to maths were discussed
All these topics become part of 'Mann Ki Baat' only because of your suggestions
Similarly
keep sending me your suggestions in future also through Namo App
MyGov
In the coming days
we will have the festival of Eid in the country
Akshaya Tritiya
the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Parashuram will also be celebrated on 3rd May
A few days later
the festival of Vaishakh Budh Purnima will also come
All these festivals are festivals of restraint
purity
charity
harmony
Advance greetings to all of you on the occasion of these festivals
Celebrate these festivals with great gaiety
harmony
In the midst of all this
you also have to be alert of Corona
Wearing a mask
washing hands at regular intervals
whatever are the necessary measures for prevention
keep following them
Next time in 'Mann Ki Baat' we will meet again
discuss some more new topics sent by you - till then let's bid goodbye.
Thank you very much!
My dear countrymen
Namaskar! In this month of August
all your letters
messages
cards have soaked my office in the hues of the tricolor
I have hardly come across any letter which does not carry the tricolor
or does not talk about the tricolor
Freedom
Children
young friends have sent beautiful pictures
artwork on the Amrit Mahotsav
In this month of independence
in our entire country
in every city
every village
the nectar of Amrit Mahotsav is flowing
On this special occasion of Amrit Mahotsav
Independence Day
we have seen the collective might of the country
There has been a sense of realisation
Such a big country
so many diversities
but when it came to hoisting the tricolor
everyone seemed to flow in the same spirit
People themselves came forward
becoming the vanguard of the pride of the tricolor
We had also seen the spirit of the country in the cleanliness campaign
the vaccination campaign
We are getting to witness the same spirit of patriotism again in the Amrit Mahotsav
Our soldiers hoisted the tricolor on the peaks of high mountains
on the borders of the country
and in the middle of the sea
People also came up with different innovative ideas for the tricolor campaign
Such as young friend
Krishnil Anil ji
Anil ji is a puzzle artist
has created beautiful tricolor mosaic art in record time
In Kolar
Karnataka
people presented a unique sight by holding the tricolor that was 630 feet long
205 feet wide.
In Assam
government employees created a 20 feet tricolor with their own hands to hoist at the Dighalipukhuri War memorial
Similarly
people in Indore made the map of India through a human chain
In Chandigarh
the youth made a giant human tricolor
Both these efforts have also been recorded in the Guinness Records
In the midst of all this
a great inspirational example was also seen at the Gangot Panchayat of Himachal Pradesh
Here the children of migrant laborers were included as chief guests in the Independence Day Programme of the Panchayat.
Friends
these colors of the Amrit Mahotsav were seen not only in India
but also in other countries of the world
Local singers living in Botswana sang 75 patriotic songs to celebrate 75 years of India's independence
What is more special in this is that these 75 songs were sung in languages like Hindi
Punjabi
Gujarati
Bangla
Assamese
Tamil
Telugu
Kannada
Sanskrit
Similarly
in Namibia
a special stamp has been released on the Indo-Namibian cultural-traditional relations.
Friends
I want to share with you another thing of joy
Just a few days ago
I got an opportunity to attend a program of Ministry of Information
Broadcasting
Government of India
There
they had organised the screening of 'Swaraj'
the Doordarshan serial
I got an opportunity to attend its premiere 
This is a great initiative to acquaint the younger generation of the country with the efforts of unsung heroes
heroines who took part in the freedom movement
It is telecast every Sunday at 9 pm on Doordarshan
And I was told that is going to continue for 75 weeks
I urge you to take time out to watch it yourself
do show it to the children of the house
And people from schools-colleges can also record it
compose a special program when the school-college opens on Monday
so that a new awakening will arise in our country about these great heroes of the birth of Freedom
The Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav will continue till next year i.e
August 2023
For the country
for the freedom fighters
the writings
events that we have been organising
we have to carry them forward.
My dear countrymen
the knowledge of our forefathers
the farsightedness of our ancestors
the EkAtmaChintan
integral self realisation is so significant even today; when we go deep into it
we are filled with wonder
Our thousands of years old Rigveda! In Rigveda it is said:-
Oman-mapo manushi: amritkam dhaat tokay tanayaaya shyamyo: |
Yooyam Hisatha Bhishjo Matritama Vishwasya Sthatu: Jagato Janitri: ||
Meaning - O water
you are the best friend of humanity
You are the giver of life
food is produced from you
and from you is the well-being of our children
You are the protector of us
keep us away from all evils
You are the best medicine
and you are the sustainer of this universe.
Think about it…the importance of water
water conservation has been explained in our culture thousands of years ago
When we see this knowledge in today's context
we are thrilled
but when the nation accepts this knowledge as its strength
then their power increases manifold
You will remember
in 'Mann Ki Baat'
I had talked about Amrit Sarovar four months ago
After that
the local administration got active in different districts
voluntary organizations came together
local people connected… -
Lo & behold
the construction of Amrit Sarovars has become a mass movement
When there is a deep feeling to do something for the country
realize one's duties
concern for the coming generations
then the capabilities also get added up
and the resolve becomes noble.
I have come to know of a brilliant effort from Warangal in Telangana
A new Gram Panchayat has been formed here
named 'Mangtya-Valya Thanda'
This village is close to the Forest Area
There was a place near the village where a lot of water used to accumulate during monsoon
On the initiative of the villagers
this place is now being developed under the Amrit Sarovar campaign
This time due to the rains during the monsoon
this lake has been filled to the brim with water.
I also want to tell you about the Amrit Sarovar built in Mocha Gram Panchayat in Mandla
Madhya Pradesh
This Amrit Sarovar is built near the Kanha National Park
has further enhanced the beauty of this area
The newly constructed Shaheed Bhagat Singh Amrit Sarovar in Lalitpur
Uttar Pradesh is also drawing a lot of people
This lake
built in the Niwari Gram Panchayat
is spread over 4 acres
The tree plantation on the shoreline of the lake is enhancing its beauty
People are also coming from far
wide to see the 35 feet high tricolor near the lake
This campaign of Amrit Sarovars is going on in full swing in Karnataka as well
Here in the village 'Bilkerur' of Bagalkot district
people have built a very beautiful Amrit Sarovar
In fact
in this area
people had a lot of problems because of the water flowing down from the mountain; farmers
their crops also suffered losses
To make the Amrit Sarovar
the people of the village channelized all the water
brought it aside
This also solved the problem of floods in the area
The Amrit Sarovar Abhiyan not only solves many of our problems today; it is equally necessary for our coming generations
Under this campaign
at many places
old water bodies are also being rejuvenated
Amrit Sarovars are being used for quenching the thirst of animals as well as for farming
Due to these ponds
the ground water table of the surrounding areas has risen
At the same time
greenery is also increasing around them
Not only this
people at many places are also engaged in preparations for fish farming in Amrit Sarovars
I urge all of you
especially my young friends
to actively participate in the Amrit Sarovar campaign
lend full strength to these efforts of water conservation & water storage
take them forward.
My dear countrymen
an interesting project is being run in Bongai village of Assam – Project Sampoorna
The purpose of this project is to fight against malnutrition
the method too is very unique
Under this
the mother of a healthy child from an Anganwadi center meets the mother of a malnourished child every week
discusses all the nutrition related information
That is
one mother becomes a friend of another mother
helps her
and teaches her
With the help of this project
in this region
in one year
malnutrition has been eradicated in more than 90 percent children.
Can you imagine
whether song
music
bhajans can also be used to remove malnutrition? It was successfully used in “Mera Bachha Campaign”; the “Mera Bachha Abhiyan” in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh
Under this
bhajan-kirtans were organized in the district
in which teachers as nutrition gurus were called
A Matka program was also held
in which women bring a handful of grains to the Anganwadi center
with this grain
a 'Balbhoj' is organized on Saturdays
Besides this increase in the attendance of children in Anganwadi centers
malnutrition has also shown a dip
A unique campaign is also going on in Jharkhand to increase awareness about malnutrition
A snake-ladder game has been prepared in Giridih
Jharkhand
Through play
children learn about good
bad habits.
Friends
I am telling you about so many innovative experiments related to malnutrition
because all of us also have to join this campaign in the coming month
The month of September is dedicated to festivals as well as a big campaign related to nutrition
We celebrate the Poshan Maah every year from the 1st to the 30th of September
Many creative
diverse efforts are being made all over the country against malnutrition
Better use of technology
also public participation has become an important part of the Nutrition campaign
From providing mobile devices to millions of Anganwadi workers in the country
a Poshan Tracker has also been launched to monitor the accessibility of Anganwadi services
In all the Aspirational Districts
the states of the North East
14 to 18 year old daughters have also been brought under the purview of the POSHAN Abhiyaan
The solution to the malady of malnutrition is not limited just to these steps - in this fight
many other initiatives also play an important role
For example
take the Jal Jeevan Mission…this mission is also going to have a huge impact in making India malnutrition free
Efforts for social awareness play an important role in tackling the challenges of malnutrition
I would urge all of you in the coming nutrition month
to take part in the efforts to eradicate malnutrition.
My dear countrymen
Sridevi Varadarajan ji from Chennai has sent me a reminder
She has written something like this on MyGov – There are less than 5 months left for the New Year to come
and we all know that the ensuing New Year will be celebrated as the International Year of Millets
She has also sent me a millet map of the country
She’s also asked if you could discuss this in the upcoming episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
It gives me immense happiness to see this kind of spirit in my countrymen
You will remember that the United Nations has passed a resolution declaring the year 2023 as the International Year of Millets
You will also be very happy to know that this proposal of India had been accepted by more than 70 countries.
Today
around the world
craze for these very coarse grains
millets
is rising
Friends
when I talk about coarse grains
I want to share one of my efforts with you today
For the last some time
when any foreign guests come to India
when Heads of State comes to India
it is my endeavor to get dishes made from the millets of India
that is
our coarse grains in the banquets
And the experience has been that these dignitaries have very much relished them
they also try to collect a lot of information about our coarse grains
about Millets
Millets
coarse grains
have been a part of our Agriculture
Culture
Civilization since ancient times
Millets are mentioned in our Vedas
and similarly
they are also mentioned in Purananuru
Tolkappiyam
If you go to any part of the country
you will definitely find different types of Millets in the food of the people there
In millets too
just like our culture
a lot of diversity is found
Jowar
Bajra
Ragi
Sawan
Kangni
Cheena
Kodo
Kutki
Kuttu
all these are just Millets
India is the largest producer of Millets in the world; hence the responsibility of making this initiative a success also rests on the shoulders of us Indians
Together we all have to make it a mass movement
and also increase the awareness of Millets among the people of the country
And friends
you know very well
millets are also beneficial for the farmers
especially the small farmers
In fact
the crop gets ready in a very short time
and does not require much water either.
For our small farmers
millets are especially beneficial
Millet hay is also considered the best fodder
Nowadays
the young generation is much focused on Healthy Living
Eating
Even if you look at it this way
millets contain plenty of protein
fiber
and minerals
Many people even call it a Superfood
Millets have many benefits
not just one
Along with reducing obesity
they also reduce the risk of diabetes
hypertension
heart related diseases
Along with that
they are also helpful in preventing stomach
liver ailments
We referred to malnutrition
just a while ago
Millets are also very beneficial in fighting malnutrition
since they are packed with energy as well as protein
Today a lot is being done to promote Millets in the country
Along with focusing on research
innovation related to this
FPOs are being encouraged
so that
production can be increased
It is my request to my farmer brothers
sisters to adopt Millets
that is
coarse grains
more
more
benefit from it
It feels good to see that many such start-ups are emerging today
which are working on Millets
Some of these are making Millet Cookies
while some are also making Millet Pancakes
Dosa
There are some who are making Millet Energy Bars
and Millet Breakfasts
I wish all the very best to all the people working in this field
In this festive season
we also use Millets in most of the dishes
You must share the pictures of such delicacies made in your homes on social media
so that it helps in increasing awareness among people about Millets.
My dear countrymen
just a few days ago
I saw news from Jorsing village in Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh
This news was about a change that the people of this village had been waiting for
for many years
In fact
in Jorsing village this month
4G internet services have started from Independence Day
Like
earlier people used to be happy when electricity reached the village; now
in new India
the same happiness is felt when 4G reaches there
There has been a new sunrise in the form of 4G in the remote areas of Arunachal
North East; internet connectivity has brought a new dawn
Facilities which were once available only in big cities
have been brought to every village through Digital India
For this reason
new digital entrepreneurs are rising in the country
Setha Singh Rawat ji of Ajmer district of Rajasthan runs 'Darzi Online'
an'E-store'
You will wonder what is Darzi online! Actually
Setha Singh Rawat used to do tailoring work before Covid
When Covid came
Rawat ji did not take this challenge as a difficulty; rather as an opportunity
He joined the 'common service centre' i.e
CSC E-Store
and started working online
He saw that customers were placing orders for masks in large numbers
He hired some women
started getting masks made
After this he started his online store named 'Darzi Online' in which he started selling stitched clothes of many other kinds
Today
with the power of Digital India
the work of Setha Singh ji has increased so much
that now he gets orders from all over the country
He has given employment to hundreds of women here
Digital India has also turned Om Prakash Singh ji of Unnao
UP into a digital entrepreneur
He has established more than one thousand broadband connections in his village
Om Prakash ji has also built a free wifi zone around his common service centre
which is helping the needy people a lot
Om Prakash ji's work has increased so much that he has hired more than 20 people
These people are providing broadband connection to the schools
hospitals
tehsil offices
Anganwadi centers of the villages
are also getting employment from it
Like the common service center
there are many such success stories are being seen on the Government E-market place i.e
GEM portal.
Friends
I get many such messages from villages
which share with me the changes brought about by the internet
The internet has changed the way our young friends study
learn
For example
when Gudiya Singh of UP came to her in-laws' house in Amoiya village of Unnao
she was worried about her studies
But
BharatNet resolved her concern
Gudiya carried on her studies through the internet
and also completed her graduation
How many such lives in villages are getting new strength from the Digital India campaign
Do write to me as much as you can about the Digital Entrepreneurs of the villages
and also share their success stories on social media.
My dear countrymen
sometime back
I received a letter from Ramesh ji
a listener of 'Mann Ki Baat' from Himachal Pradesh
Ramesh ji has enumerated many specialities of the hills in his letter
He wrote that the settlements on the mountains might be far apart
but the hearts of the people are very close to each other
Indeed
we can learn a lot from the lives of the people living in the hills
The first lesson we get from the lifestyle
culture of the hills is that if we do not come under the pressure of circumstances
we can easily overcome them
and secondly
how we can become self-sufficient with local resources
The first lesson that I mentioned
a beautiful picture of it is being seen in the Spiti region these days
Spiti is a tribal area
Here
these days
pea plucking goes on
This is a laborious
difficult task on hill farms
But here
the women of the village gather
and together
pluck peas from each other's fields
Along with this task
women also sing the local song 'Chhapra Majhi Chhapra'
That is
mutual cooperation here is also a part of folk tradition
The best example of utilization of local resources is also found in Spiti
Farmers who rear cows in Spiti
dry up the dung
fill it in sacks
When winter comes
these sacks are laid out in the sheds where the cows live
which is called khud here
During snowfall
these sacks give protection to the cows from the cold
After winters
this cow dung is used as manure in the fields
That is
the animals’ protection using animal waste
and also manure for the fields
The cost of cultivation is also low
and the yield in the fields is also high
That is why this area
these days
is also becoming an inspiration for natural farming.
Friends
many such commendable efforts are also being seen in our
other hill state
Uttarakhand
Many types of medicines
plants are found in Uttarakhand
which are very beneficial for our health
One of them is the fruit – Bedu
It is also known as Himalayan Fig
In this fruit
minerals
vitamins are found in abundance
People consume it not only in the form of fruit
but it is also used in the treatment of many diseases
In view of these qualities of this fruit
now the juice of Bedu
jams
chutneys
pickles
dry fruits prepared by drying them have been launched in the market
With the initiative of the Pithoragarh administration
the cooperation of the local people
it has been successful in bringing Bedu to the market in different forms
Bedu has also been launched in the online market by branding it as Pahari Fig
Due to this
farmers have not only found a new source of income
but the benefits of the medicinal properties of Bedu have started reaching far
wide as well.
My dear countrymen
in the beginning of 'Mann Ki Baat'
today
we referred to the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav
Along with the great festival of Independence Day
many more festivals are lined up in the coming days
Just a few days from now
is the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi
the festival of worship of Bhagwan Ganesha
Ganesh Chaturthi
that is
the festival of blessings of Ganpati Bappa
The festival of Onam is also commencing before Ganesh Chaturthi
Onam
especially in Kerala
will be celebrated with a sense of peace
prosperity
Hartalika Teej too is on the 30th of August
The festival of Nuakhai will also be celebrated in Odisha on the 1st of September
Nuakhai simply means new food
that is
this too
like many other festivals
is a festival associated with our agricultural traditions
Meanwhile
there will also be the Samvatsari festival of the Jain community
All these festivals of ours are synonymous with our cultural prosperity
vitality
I wish you all the best for these festivals
special occasions
Along with these festivals
tomorrow on the 29th of August
National Sports Day will also be celebrated on the birth anniversary of Major Dhyanchand ji
May our young sportspersons continue to raise the glory of our tricolor on global forums
this will be our tribute to Dhyan Chand ji
Let us all keep working together for the country like this; keep raising the honor of the country…With this wish I conclude my point
Next month
we will have 'Mann Ki Baat' once again.
Thank you very much!
My dear countrymen
Namaskar.
Today we are coming together for the ninety-sixth (96) episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
The next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' will be the first episode of the year 2023
In the messages sent by you
you have also urged to speak about the departing 2022
Observation of the past always gives us inspiration for preparations for the present
the future
In 2022
the strength of the people of the country
their cooperation
their resolve
their expansion of success was of such magnitude that it would be difficult to include all of those in 'Mann Ki Baat'
2022 has indeed been very inspiring
wonderful in many ways
This year India completed 75 years of her independence
this very year Amritkal commenced
This year the country gained a new momentum
all the countrymen performed one better than the other
The various successes of 2022
today
have created a special place for India all over the world
2022 i.e
India attaining the status of the world's fifth largest economy; 2022
i.e
the record of India surpassing the incredible figure of 220 crore vaccines; 2022,i.e
India crossing the magical exports figure of 400 billion dollars; 2022
i.e
adopting the resolution of 'Self-reliant India' by the people
enliving it; 2022 meaning welcoming India's first indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant
2022 meaning India's glory in Space
Drone
Defence Sector
2022 meaning India's might in every field | Even in the field of sports
be it the Commonwealth Games
or the victory of our women's hockey team
our youth have shown tremendous potential.
Friends
along with all this
the year 2022 will always be remembered for one more reason
This is the extension of the spirit of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'
The people of the country also organized many amazing events to celebrate unity
togetherness
Be it the Madhavpur Mela in Gujarat
where Rukmini's marriage
and Lord Krishna's relationship with the Northeast is celebrated
or the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam
many colors of unity were visible in these festivals
In 2022
the countrymen have scripted another chapter of immortal history
Who can forget the 'Har GharTiranga' campaign organised in the month of August! Those were the moments giving every countryman goose bumps
In this campaign of 75 years of independence
the whole country assumed the hues of the tricolor
More than 6 crore people even sent selfies with the tricolor
This Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav will continue in the same way next year as well - it will further strengthen the foundation of Amrit Kaal.
Friends
this year India has also got the responsibility of chairing the G-20 group
I had also discussed this in detail last time
In the year 2023
we have to take the enthusiasm of G-20 to new heights; make this event a mass movement.
My dear countrymen
today the festival of Christmas is also being celebrated with great fervour all over the world
It is a day to remember the life
teachings of Jesus Christ
I wish you all a Merry Christmas.
Friends
today is also the birthday of our respected Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji
He was a great statesman who gave exceptional leadership to the country
He has a special place in the heart of every Indian
I have received a letter from Aasthaji from Kolkata
In this letter
she has mentioned about her recent visit to Delhi
She writes that during this
she took time out to visit the PM Museum
She liked Atal ji's gallery very much in this museum
The picture clicked there with Atal ji has become memorable for her
In Atal ji's gallery
we can have a glimpse of his valuable contribution to the country
Be it infrastructure
education or foreign policy
he strove to take India to new heights in every field
I once again solemnly bow to Atal ji from the core of my heart.
Friends
tomorrow
the 26th of December is 'Veer Bal Diwas'
I will have the privilege of participating in a programme dedicated to the martyrdom of Sahibzada Zorawar Singh ji
Sahibzada Fateh Singh ji in Delhi on this occasion
The country will always remember the sacrifice of Sahibzade
Mata Gujri.
My dear countrymen
it is said here –
Satyam kim pramanam
pratyaksham kim pramanam.
That is
truth does not require proof
what is evident also does not require proof.
But when it comes to modern Medical Science
the most important thing is - Evidence
Lack of evidence based research in the context of our scriptures like Yoga
Ayurveda has always been a challenge which has been a part of Indian life for centuries- results are visible
but evidence is not
But
I am happy that in the era of Evidence-based medicine
Yoga
Ayurveda are now standing up to the touchstone of tests of the modern era
All of you must have heard about the Tata Memorial center in Mumbai
This institute has earned a name for itself in Research
Innovation
Cancer care
An intensive research done by this center has revealed that yoga is very effective for breast cancer patients
Tata Memorial Center has presented the results of its research in the very prestigious Breast cancer conference held in America
These results have attracted the attention of the world's biggest experts
Because
Tata Memorial center has conveyed with evidence how patients have benefited from Yoga
According to the research of this center
regular practice of yoga has reduced the risk of recurrence
death of breast cancer patients by 15 percent
This is the first example of Indian traditional medicine being tested vis a vis the stringent standards of Western methods
Also
this is the first study
in which yoga has been found to improve the quality of life in women affected by breast cancer
Its long term benefits have also come to the fore
The Tata Memorial Center has presented the results of its study at the European Society of Medical Oncology conference in Paris.
Friends
In today's era
the more evidence-based Indian medical systems are
the more their acceptance will increase in the whole world
With this thought
an effort is also being made in Delhi's AIIMS
Here
the Center for Integrative Medicine
Research was established six years ago to validate our traditional medical practices
Latest Modern Techniques
Research Methods are used in this
The center has already published 20 papers in reputed international journals
A paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology describes the benefits of yoga for patients suffering from syncope
Similarly
in a Paper of Neurology Journal
in Migraine
the benefits of yoga have been explained
Apart from these
studies are being done regarding the benefits of yoga in many other diseases as well
Like Heart Disease
Depression
Sleep Disorder
problems faced by women during pregnancy.
Friends
a few days ago I was in Goa for the World Ayurveda Congress
Delegates from more than 40 countries participated in it
more than 550 Scientific Papers were presented here
Around 215 companies from around the world including India displayed their products in the exhibition here
In this expo which went on for four days
more than one lakh people enjoyed their experience related to Ayurveda
Even in the Ayurveda Congress
I reiterated the point for evidence based research to the Ayurveda experts gathered from all over the world
The way we all are seeing the power of Yoga
Ayurveda in this time of the Corona global pandemic
evidence-based research related to these will prove to be very significant
I also urge you that if you have any information about such efforts related to Yoga
Ayurveda
our traditional treatment methods
then do share them on social media.
My dear countrymen
in the last few years we have overcome many major challenges related to the health sector
Full credit for this goes to the willpower of our Medical Experts
Scientists
countrymen
We have eradicated diseases like Smallpox
Polio
'Guinea Worm' from India.
Today
I would like to tell the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' about another challenge
which is now about to end
This challenge
this disease is 'Kala Azar'
The parasite of this disease is spread through the sting of the sand fly
When someone has 'Kala Azar'
one has fever for months
there is anemia
the body becomes weak
the weight also decreases
This disease can happen to anyone from children to elders
But with everyone's efforts
this disease named 'Kala Azar' is now getting eradicated rapidly
Till recently
the scourge of Kala-azar had spread in more than 50 districts across 4 states
But now this disease is confined to only 4 districts of Bihar
Jharkhand
I am sure
the strength
awareness of the people of Bihar-Jharkhand will help the government's efforts to eliminate 'Kala Azar' from these four districts as well
I also urge the people of 'Kala Azar' affected areas to keep two things in mind
One is - control of sand fly
and second
diagnosis
complete treatment of this disease as soon as possible
The treatment of 'Kala Azar' is easy; the medicines used for this are also very effective
You just have to be alert
Do not be negligent if you have fever
and also keep spraying medicines that kill the sand fly
Just think
when our country will be free from 'Kala Azar'
it will be a matter of joy for all of us
In this spirit of Sab ka Prayas
we are also working towards eradication of T.B
in India
by 2025
You must have seen
in the recent past
when the T.B
Mukt Bharat campaign started
thousands of people came forward to help the T.B
patients
These people
as Nikshay Mitras
are taking care of the patients
helping them financially
This power of public service
public participation achieves every difficult goal with certainty.
My dear countrymen
our tradition
culture have an unbreakable connection with Ma Ganga
Ganga water has been an integral part of our way of life
it is also said in our scriptures:-
Namami Gange Tav Paad Pankajam,
Sur Asurai: Vandit Divya Roopam |
Bhuktim cha muktim cha dadasi nityam,
Bhaav Anusaaren Sadaa Naraanaam ||
Meaning
O Mother Ganga! You bestow worldly happiness
bliss
salvation on your devotees according to their wishes
All worship your holy feet
I also offer my salutations at your holy feet
Amid that
it is a big responsibility of all of us to keep clean Mother Ganges that has been flowing for centuries
With this objective
eight years ago
we started the 'Namami Gange Campaign'
It is a matter of pride for all of us that
today
this initiative of India is getting appreciation from all over the world
The United Nations has included the 'Namami Gange' mission in the world's top ten initiatives to restore the ecosystem
It is even more heartening that 'Namami Gange' has received this honor among 160 such initiatives from all over the world.
Friends
the biggest source of energy behind the 'Namami Gange' campaign is the continuous participation of the people
In the 'NamamiGange' campaign
Ganga Praharis
Ganga Doots also have a big role to play
They are engaged in spreading awareness through planting trees
cleaning ghats
Ganga Aarti
street plays
painting
poems
A lot of improvement is also being seen in Biodiversity due to this campaign
There has been a significant increase in the number of different species of Hilsa fish
Gangetic dolphin
turtles
With Ganga's ecosystem being clean
other livelihood opportunities are also increasing
Here I would like to discuss the ‘Jalaj Ajeevika Model'
which has been prepared keeping Biodiversity in mind
This Tourism-based Boat Safaris has been launched at 26 Locations.
Obviously
the spread of the 'Namami Gange' mission
its scope
has increased much more than the cleaning of the river
Whereas this evidence is direct proof of our willpower
tireless efforts
on the other hand
it is also going to show a new path to the world in the direction of environmental protection.
My dear countrymen
when the power of our resolve is strong
even the biggest challenge becomes easy
The example of this has been set by Sange Sherpa ji of Thegu village of Sikkim
For the last 14 years
he is engaged in the work of environmental protection at an altitude of more than 12,000 feet
Sange ji has taken up the task of keeping clean the Tsomgo (Somgo) lake that is of cultural
mythological importance
With his untiring efforts
he has changed the look
feel of this glacier lake
When Sange Sherpa ji started this campaign of cleanliness in the year 2008
he had to face many difficulties
But within no time
along with the youth
villagers
the panchayat also started offering full support in this noble work
Today
if you go to see the Tsomgolake
you will find huge garbage bins all around there
Now the garbage collected here is sent for recycling
Garbage bags made of cloth are also given to the tourists coming here so that the garbage is not strewn around
Now about 5 lakh tourists reach here every year to see this very clean lake
Sange Sherpa has also been honored by many organizations for this unique effort to conserve Tsomgo (Somgo) lake
Due to such efforts
today Sikkim is counted among the cleanest states of India
Along with Sange Sherpa ji
his colleagues
I also heartily appreciate the people engaged in the noble effort of environmental protection across the country.
Friends
I am happy that the 'Swachh Bharat Mission' has become firmly rooted in the mind of every Indian today
Since the inception of this mass movement in the year 2014
to take it to new heights
many unique efforts have been made by the people.
These efforts are being made not only within the society but also on part of the government
The result of these continuous efforts is that - due to the removal of garbage
removal of unnecessary items
a lot of space opens up in the offices
new space is available
Earlier
due to lack of space
offices had to be maintained on rent at far off places
These days
due to this cleanliness
so much space is available
that
now
all the offices are converging at one place
In the past
even the Ministry of Information
Broadcasting also made a lot of effort in its offices in Mumbai
Ahmedabad
Kolkata
Shillong in many cities
because of that
today they have two
three floors
available completely in usage anew
Due to this cleanliness in itself
we are getting the best experience of optimum utilizations of our resources
In the society as well as in the villages
cities
even in the offices; even for the country
this campaign is proving useful in every way.
My dear countrymen
a new awareness is dawning in our country about our art
culture
a new consciousness is awakening
In 'Mann Ki Baat'
we often discuss such examples
Just as art
literature
culture are the collective capital of the society
in the same way
it is the responsibility of the whole society to take them forward
One such successful effort is being made in Lakshadweep
There is a club on Kalpeni Island – Kummel Brothers Challengers Club
This club inspires the youth to preserve the local culture
traditional arts
Here the youth are trained in the local art Kolkali
Parichakli
Kilipaat
traditional songs
That is
the old heritage is being protected in the hands of the new generation
is moving forward
friends
I am happy that such efforts are being made not only in the country but also abroad
Recently news came in from Dubai that the Kalari club there has registered its name in the Guinness Book of World Records
Anyone could think that if Dubai's club set a record
what is its relation with India? Actually
this record is related to Kalaripayattu
the ancient martial art of India
This record is for the performance of Kalari by the maximum number of people simultaneously
Kalari club Dubai
together with Dubai Police
planned this
displayed it on the National Day of UAE
In this event
people ranging from 4 years old children to 60 years olds showed their best ability of Kalari
This is a wonderful example of how different generations are carrying forward an ancient tradition
with full inner enthusiasm.
Friends
I would also like to inform the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' about 'Quemashree' ji
who lives in Gadak district of Karnataka
In the South
'Quemshree' has been continuously engaged for the last 25 years in the mission of reviving the art-culture of Karnataka
You can imagine how great his Tpasya is! Earlier he was associated with the profession of Hotel Management
But
his attachment to his culture
tradition was so deep that he made it his mission
He created a platform by the name of 'Kala Chetna'
This platform
today
organizes many programs of artists from Karnataka
from India
abroad
In this
many innovative endeavours are also undertaken to promote local art
culture.
Friends
this enthusiasm of the countrymen towards their art
culture is a manifestation of the feeling of 'pride in our heritage'
In our country
there are so many such colors scattered in every corner
We should also work continuously to adorn
preserve them.
My dear countrymen
many beautiful
useful things are made from bamboo in many areas of the country
There are skilled bamboo artisans
skilled artists
especially in tribal areas
Ever since the country changed the British-era laws related to bamboo
a huge market has developed for it
Even in areas like Palghar in Maharashtra
tribal people make many beautiful products from bamboo
Things like boxes
chairs
teapots
baskets
and trays made of bamboo are becoming very popular
Not only this
these people also make beautiful clothes
decorations from bamboo grass
This is also providing employment to tribal women
their talent is also getting recognition.
Friends
a couple from Karnataka is sending many unique products made from betelnut fiber to the international market
This is a couple from Shivamogga in Karnataka – Shriman Suresh
his wife Shrimati Maithili
These people are making many decorative things ranging from trays
plates
handbags from betel nut fiber
Chappals made of this fiber are also being liked a lot today
Today their products are being sold in London
other markets of Europe
This is the very quality of our natural resources
traditional skills
which is being liked by everyone
In this traditional knowledge of India
the world is looking at ways of a sustainable future
We ourselves also need to be more
more aware in this direction
We ourselves should use such indigenous
local products
gift them to others as well
This will also strengthen our identity
strengthen the local economy
and
in large numbers
brighten the future of the people.
My dear countrymen
now we are slowly moving towards the unprecedented milestone of the 100th episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
I have received letters from many countrymen
in which they have expressed great inquisitiveness about the 100th episode
I would like it if you send me your suggestions for what we should talk about in the 100th episode
how to make it special
Next time we will meet in the year 2023
I wish you all the best for the year 2023.
May this year also be special for the country
may the country keep touching new heights
and together we have to take a resolution as well as make it come true
At this time many people are also in the mood for holidays
Enjoy these festivals a lot
but be a little cautious too
You are also seeing that
Corona is increasing in many countries of the world
so we have to take more care of precautions like mask
hand washing
If we are careful
then we will also be safe
there will be no hindrance in our enjoyment
With this
once again many best wishes to all of you
Thank you very much
Namaskar.
My dear countrymen
Namaskar!
Welcome to 'Mann Ki Baat' once again
Today we will commence 'Mann Ki Baat' mentioning India's success
In the beginning of this month
India has been successful in bringing home an invaluable heritage of hers from Italy
This heritage is the over one thousand years old idol of Avalokiteshvara Padmapani
This idol was stolen a few years ago from Kundalpur temple
Devi Sthan of Gaya ji in Bihar
But after innumerable efforts
India has now got this idol back
Similarly
a few years ago the idol of Lord Anjaneyaar
Hanuman ji was stolen from Vellore in Tamil Nadu
This idol of Hanuman ji was also 600-700 years old
Earlier this month
we retrieved this in Australia; our Mission has received it.
Friends
in our history of thousands of years
idols
one better than the other were always being made in various parts of the country; it also comprised reverence
capability
skill
was full of varied diversity
And the history of each of our idols also depicts the influence of their respective times
Not only were they a wonderful artistic example of Indian sculpture; our faith was also connected with them
But
in the past
many idols were stolen
kept being taken out of India
Sometimes in this country
at times in another
these idols were sold..
and for them they were just pieces of art
Neither did they have anything to do with their history
nor with reverence attached to them
It is our responsibility towards Mother India to bring home these idols
These idols embody a part of the soul of India; faith as well
They also have a cultural-historical significance
Realising this responsibility
India increased her efforts
And resultantly
it fostered a deterrent fear against the tendency to steal
The countries where these idols were stolen
taken away to
also started to feel now that it could also have immense significance in the diplomatic channel of soft power in relations with India
India's feelings are associated with it; India's reverence is attached as well
and
in a way
it creates a lot of strength in people-to-people relations as well
Just a few days ago you must have noted that the idol of Ma Annapurna Devi
which was stolen from Kashi
was also brought back
This is an example of the changing global outlook towards India
Till the year 2013
nearly 13 idols had been brought back to India
But
in the last seven years
India has successfully brought back more than 200 precious idols
Many countries such as America
Britain
Holland
France
Canada
Germany
Singapore have understood this sentiment of India
helped us to retrieve these idols
When I went to America in September last year
I came across a lot of very old idols
many artefacts of cultural importance there
Whenever any priceless heritage returns to the country
it is naturally a matter of great satisfaction for all of us....as an Indian
as one who has reverence for history
archaeology
one connected with faith
culture.
Friends
talking about Indian culture
our heritage
today I want to introduce you to two people in 'Mann Ki Baat'
These days
two Tanzanian siblings
Kili Paul
his sister Nima
are in the news a lot on Facebook
Twitter
Instagram
and I'm sure you too
must have heard about them
They have a passion
a craze for Indian music
for this reason they are also very popular
Their technique of Lip Sync shows how hard they work at it
Recently
a video of him singing our National Anthem 'Jana Gana Mana' on the occasion of Republic Day went viral
A few days ago
he also paid a soulful tribute to Lata didi by presenting her song
I really appreciate these two siblings Kili
Nima very much for their wonderful creativity
A few days ago
he has also been honoured at the Indian Embassy in Tanzania
The magic of Indian music is such that it fascinates everyone
I recall
a few years ago
singers-musicians from more than one hundred
fifty countries of the world
in their respective countries
in their respective costumes
made a successful presentation of 'Vaishnav Jan'
the beloved bhajan of revered Bapu
the favourite composition of Mahatma Gandhi.
Today
when India is celebrating the important festival of 75th year of its Independence
similar initiatives can be carried out regarding patriotic songs
wherein foreign nationals or famous singers from abroad are invited to render Indian patriotic songs
Not only this
if Kili
Neema in Tanzania can lip sync the songs of India in this manner
aren’t there many types of songs in my country..
in many languages ​​​​of our country..
can’t any Gujarati children do that with Tamil songs....some children of Kerala could do that with Assamese songs...
some Kannada children could that with songs of Jammu
Kashmir! We can create such an environment in which we will be able to experience 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'
Not only this
we can definitely celebrate Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav in a novel way
I urge the youth of the country to make videos of the popular songs of Indian languages ​​in their own way...
you will become very popular! And the diversity of the country will be introduced to the new generation.
My dear countrymen
just a few days ago
we celebrated International Mother Language Day
Those who are learned can give a lot of academic input about where the word mother tongue came from
how it originated
I would emphasise about mother tongue that as our mother moulds our life
in the same manner
mother tongue also shapes our life
The mother
mother tongue
both together strengthen the foundation of life; lending it permanence
Just like we cannot abandon our mother
similarly
we cannot leave our mother tongue either
I remember an incident of yesteryears
when I had gone to America
I would get a chance to visit different families
Once I went to a Telugu family
I got to see a very happy scenario there
They told me that they had made a rule in the family that no matter how busy one were to be
if they were not outstation
then all the family members would have dinner sitting at the table together
equally compulsory on the dinner table was conversing in Telugu language only
This was also the rule for the children who were born there
Seeing this love for the mother tongue
I was highly impressed by this family.
Friends
even after 75 years of independence
some people are facing a mental dilemma due to which they have reservations with regard to their language
their dress
their food
drink
whereas
it is not like this anywhere else in the world
It is our mother tongue; we should speak it with pride
And
our India is so rich in terms of languages ​​that it just cannot be compared
The biggest beauty of our languages ​​is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
from Kutch to Kohima
hundreds of languages
thousands of dialects which are different from each other but are mutually integrated...many languages - one expression
For centuries
our languages have been evolving whilst learning from each other
​​have been refining themselves
developing each other
The world’s oldest language Tamil is in India
every Indian should be proud that we have such a significant heritage of the world
In the same way
many ancient scriptures are also there; their expression too is in our Sanskrit language
The people of India are proud to be associated with 121 forms of mother tongues
14 of these languages ​​are spoken by more than 1 crore people in everyday life
That is
many European countries do not have a total population than the people who are associated with 14 different languages ​​in our country
In the year 2019
Hindi was ranked third among the most spoken languages ​​of the world
Every Indian should be proud of this too
Language is not just a medium of expression
but also serves to preserve the culture
heritage of the society
Surjan Parohi ji is doing similar work in Suriname to save the heritage of his language
He turned 84 on the 2nd of this month
His forefathers also went to Suriname years ago
along with thousands of workers
to earn a living
Surjan Parohi ji writes very good poetry in Hindi; his name is considered among the national poets there
That is
even today Hindustan beats in his heart; there is a fragrance of the soil of India in his works
The people of Suriname have also built a museum in the name of Surjan Parohi ji
It is very heartening for me that in the year 2015 I had the opportunity to honour him.
Friends
today
that is
27th February is also Marathi Bhasha Gaurav Divas.
“सर्व मराठी बंधु भगिनिना मराठी भाषा दिनाच्या हार्दिक शुभेच्छा|”
This day is dedicated to Marathi Kaviraj
Vishnu Vaman Shirvadkar ji
Shriman Kusumagraj ji
Today is also the birth anniversary of Kusumagraj ji
Kusumagraj ji wrote poems in Marathi
wrote many plays
and took Marathi literature to new heights.
Friends
our languages have their own special characteristics; mother tongue has its own science
For understanding this science
emphasis has been laid on studies in the local language in the National Education Policy
Efforts are being made that our professional courses should also be taught in the regional languages
In Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal
we all should lend momentum to this effort together; this is a work indicative of self-respect
I would like you to know about the qualities of whatever mother tongue you speak
write something in it.
Friends
A few days ago I had a meeting with my friend
former Prime Minister of Kenya
Raila Odinga
This meeting was interesting but also very emotional
Since we are very good friends
we also discuss freely
While both of us were in a conversation
Odinga ji told about his daughter
His daughter Rosemary had a brain tumour
because of this she had to undergo surgery
However
one side-effect of this was that Rosemary almost lost her eyesight; she stopped seeing
You can imagine what must have happened to the daughter...
and we can also guess the condition of the father
we can understand his feelings
In hospitals all over the world..
there was not any major country in the world
where he had not tried his best for the treatment of his daughter
He searched the big countries of the world
but
there was no success
in a way
giving up all hopes
there was an atmosphere of despair in the entire household
Meanwhile
someone suggested him to come to India for Ayurveda treatment
even though he had tried a lot
was tired
yet he thought that let's try once again..
see what happens! He came to India
started getting his daughter treated at an Ayurvedic hospital in Kerala
The daughter stayed here for a long time
The effect of this Ayurvedic treatment was such that Rosemary's eyesight returned to a great extent
You can imagine
as if a new lease of life was given
light came back into Rosemary's life
As the new light has come in the whole family
Odinga ji was so emotional while telling me this
that he wishes
that the knowledge
science of Ayurveda of India
should be brought to Kenya
The type of plants that are used in it will be cultivated by them
he will do his best to get more people to benefit from it.
It is a matter of great happiness for me that from our land
our tradition have alleviated such a great suffering from someone's life
You will also be happy to hear this
Which Indian would not be proud of it? We all know that not only Odinga ji but lakhs of people across the world are reaping similar benefits from Ayurveda.
Prince Charles from Britain is also one of the big admirers of Ayurveda
Whenever I meet him
he definitely mentions Ayurveda
He is also aware of many Ayurvedic institutions of India.
Friends
in the last seven years a lot of attention has been paid to the promotion of Ayurveda in the country
The formation of the Ministry of AYUSH has further strengthened our resolve to popularise our traditional methods of medicine
health
I am very happy that in the last few years many new start-ups have emerged in the field of Ayurveda
The AYUSH Start-up Challenge started earlier this month
The goal of this challenge is to identify
support the start-ups working in this field
I urge the youth working in this field
that they should take part in this challenge.
Friends
once people are determined to do something together
they do wonderful things
There have been many such big changes in the society
in which public participation
collective effort
has played a significant role
One such mass movement named "Mission Jal Thal" is underway in Srinagar
Kashmir
This is a unique effort to clean the lakes
ponds of Srinagar
restore their old glory
The focus of “Mission Jal Thal” is on “Kushal Saar”
“Gil Saar”
Along with public participation
a lot of help of technology is also being taken in this
To find out where there has been encroachment
where illegal construction has taken place
a formal survey of this area was carried out
Along with this
a campaign to remove plastic waste
clean up the waste was also launched
In the second phase of the mission
a lot of effort was also made to restore the old water channels
19 springs filling the lake
In order to spread more
more awareness about the importance of this Restoration Project
local people
youth were also made Water Ambassadors
Now the local people here are also taking efforts for increasing the number of migratory birds
fish in "Gil Saar Lake"
are also happy to see it
My heartiest congratulations to the people of Srinagar for this wonderful effort.
Friends
the 'Clean India Mission' started by the country eight years ago
with the passage of time
it expanded manifold..
new innovations were also added
Wherever you go in India
you will find that some effort is being made for cleanliness everywhere
I have come to know about one such attempt in Kokrajhar
Assam
Here a group of morning walkers have taken a very commendable initiative under the 'Clean
Green Kokrajhar' mission
All of them gave a motivational message of cleanliness by cleaning the three kilometre long road in the new flyover area
Similarly
under the 'Clean India Campaign' in Visakhapatnam
cloth bags are being promoted instead of polythene
People here are also campaigning against Single Use Plastic products to keep the environment clean
Along with this
these people are also spreading awareness to segregate the waste at home
The students of Somaiya College in Mumbai have also included beautification in their campaign of cleanliness
They have decorated the walls of Kalyan railway station with beautiful paintings
An inspiring example from Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan has also come to my notice
The youth here have started a campaign named 'Mission Beat Plastic' in Ranthambore
in which plastic
polythene have been removed from the forests of Ranthambore
This spirit of Sabka Prayas
everyone's effort strengthens public participation in the country
when there is public participation
even the biggest goals are definitely met.
My dear countrymen
just a few days from today
International Women's Day will be celebrated all over the world on 8th of March
We have been sharing many examples related to the courage
skill
and talent of women in 'Mann Ki Baat'
Today
whether it is Skill India
Self Help Group
small or big industries
women have taken the lead everywhere
Wherever you see
women are dispelling old myths
Today
in our country
From Parliament to Panchayat
women are reaching newer heights in different fields
In the Army too
daughters are now playing responsibilities in new
bigger roles
are protecting the country
Last month on Republic Day we saw that daughters were flying modern fighter planes too
The country also lifted the restrictions on the admission of daughters in Sainik Schools
and daughters are taking admission in Sainik Schools all over the country
Similarly
look at the start-up world
in the recent years
thousands of new start-ups began in the country
About half of these start-ups have women in director roles
In the recent past
decisions like increasing maternity leave for women have been taken
The country is trying to give equal rights to sons
daughters by fixing a common age for marriage
Due to this
the participation of women is increasing in every field
You must be noticing another major change happening in the country
This change is the success of our social campaigns
Take the success of 'Beti Bachao
Beti Padhao'..
today the sex ratio in the country has improved
The number of girls going to school has also improved
In this we also have a responsibility that our daughters do not drop out of school
Similarly
women in the country have got freedom from open defecation under the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyan'
A social evil like triple talaq is also coming to an end
Ever since the law against triple talaq has come into being
there has been a reduction of 80 percent in triple talaq cases in the country
How are all these changes happening in such a short span of time? This change is coming because women themselves are now leading the change
progressive efforts in our country.
My dear countrymen
tomorrow the 28th of February is 'National Science Day'
This day is also known for the discovery of Raman Effect
Along with CV Raman ji
I pay my respectful tribute to all the scientists who have contributed significantly in enriching our scientific journey
Friends
technology has secured an important place in our lives in the realm of ease
simplicity
Which technology is good
what is the better use of that technology
we are well acquainted with all these subjects
But
it is also true that the basis of that technology
the underlying science is something that we neglect in conveying to the children of our family
On this Science Day
I urge all the families to definitely start with small efforts to develop a scientific temperament in their children.
Now
for example – poor vision..
after wearing glasses
vision improves with clarity..
children can easily be explained on the science behind it
It’s not that one should restrict oneself to just looking at the glasses
enjoying
Now you can simply explain to the child on a small piece of paper
Now the child uses a mobile phone...how does a calculator work
how does a remote control work
what are sensors? Along with this
are such scientific elements also discussed in the house? Maybe we can easily explain these things behind the everyday functioning of the household
what is the inherent science behind a phenomenon
In the same way
have we ever indulged in stargazing together with the children? There must have been conversations about stars in the night
Different constellations appear
tell them about them
By doing this you can create a new interest in children towards physics
astronomy
Nowadays
there are also many apps through which you can locate the stars
planets
or
you can identify the star which is visible in the sky
can also know about it
I will also tell our start-ups that you should employ your skills
scientific character in the work related to nation-building
This is also our Collective Scientific Responsibility towards the country
Like
nowadays I see that our start-ups are doing very well in the world of virtual reality
In this era of virtual classes
one such virtual lab can be designed keeping children in mind
We can also make children experience a chemistry lab sitting at home through virtual reality
My request to my teachers
parents is to encourage all the students
children to ask questions
together with them find the right answers to those questions
Today
I would also like to appreciate the role of Indian scientists in the fight against Corona
Due to their hard work
it was possible to manufacture the Made In India vaccine
which has helped the whole world a lot
This is the gift of science to humanity.
My dear countrymen
this time too we discussed many subjects
Many festivals are lined up in the coming month of March..
Shivratri..
A few days later we will all will start preparing for Holi
Holi is a festival that unites us all
In this festival
all differences between near-dear ones
strangers
big
small
rancour
envy disappear
That is why it is said that the colours of love
harmony are thicker than the colours of Holi
Along with Gujiya in Holi
there is a unique sweetness of relationships as well
We have to strengthen these bonds further
and relations are not only with the people of our family but also with the people who are part of your larger family
You have to remember the most important way to do so
This is the way of celebrating the festival through 'Vocal for Local'
You should buy local products on festivals
so that the lives of the people living around you also become colourful
vibrant
The success with which our country is fighting the battle against Corona
moving forward is imparting enthusiasm to the festivals manifold
With this very zeal
we have to celebrate our festivals
and at the same time
we have to maintain our caution
I wish you all a very Happy festival season
I will always be waiting for your words
your letters
your messages.
Thank you very much!
My dear countrymen
Namaskar
Today we are coming together through yet another episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
This is the first 'Mann Ki Baat' of 2022
Today we will once again take forward discussions which are related to the positive inspirations
collective efforts of our country
countrymen
Today is also the death anniversary of our revered Bapu Mahatma Gandhi ji
The 30th of January reminds us of the teachings of Bapu
Just a few days ago
we celebrated Republic Day as well
The display of the nation's valour
strength
which we witnessed on Rajpath in Delhi filled everyone with pride
enthusiasm
One change you must have noticed is that now the Republic Day functions will start from the 23rd of January
i.e
the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose
will continue till the 30th of January i.e
Gandhiji's death anniversary
A digital sculpture of Netaji has also been installed at India Gate
We can never forget the way the country welcomed this
the wave of joy that arose from every corner of the country; the kind of feelings expressed by every countryman.
Friends
in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav
the country is re-establishing its national symbols through these efforts
We saw that the 'Amar Jawan Jyoti' near India Gate
the Jyoti lit at the 'National War Memorial' in the vicinity
were merged
There were tears in the eyes of many countrymen
martyr families on this emotional occasion
At the 'National War Memorial'
the names of all the bravehearts of the country who have been martyred since Independence have been inscribed
Some former soldiers of the army have written to me saying that - "The 'Amar Jawan Jyoti' lit at the memorial is a symbol of the immortality of the martyrs"
Truly
like 'Amar Jawan Jyoti' our martyrs
their inspiration
their contribution are also immortal
I would urge all of you to certainly visit the 'National War Memorial' whenever you get an opportunity
Do take along your family
children too
Here you will feel a different energy
inspiration.
Friends
in the midst of these events of Amrit Mahotsav
many important national awards were also given away in the country
One of them is the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Baal Puraskaar
These awards are given to the children who have rendered courageous
inspirational work at a young age
We all must highlight about these children in our homes
Our children will also get inspiration from this
the enthusiasm to bring glory to the country will be awakened in them
Padma awards have also just been announced in the country
There are many names among the recipients of Padma awards
about whom very few people know
These are the unsung heroes of our country
who have done extraordinary deeds in ordinary circumstances
For example
Basanti Devi of Uttarakhand
who has been honored with Padma Shri
lived her whole life in the midst of struggles
Her husband died at an early age
she had started living in an ashram
Staying there
she fought to save the river
made an extraordinary contribution to the environment
She has also done a lot of work for the empowerment of women
Similarly
77-year-old Lorembam Beino Devi of Manipur has been conserving the Liba textile art of Manipur for decades
She has also been awarded the Padma Shri
Arjun Singh of Madhya Pradesh has received Padma award for imparting recognition to the art of Baiga tribal dance
Another person to receive the Padma award is Shriman Amai Mahalinga Naik
He is a farmer
hails from Karnataka
Some people also call him Tunnel Man
He has made such innovations in agriculture
seeing which anyone could be surprised
Small farmers are getting huge benefit from his efforts
There are many more such unsung heroes who have been honoured by the country for their contribution
You must try to know about them
We will get to learn a lot from them in life.
My dear countrymen
all of you send a lot of letters
messages
including many suggestions in connection with The Amrit Mahotsav
Under this series something has happened which is unforgettable for me
More than one crore children have written to me through their 'Mann Ki Baat' post cards
These one crore post cards have come from different parts of the country; they have also come from abroad
I have tried to take time out to read many of these post cards
These postcards show how broad
wide is the vision of our new generation for the future of the country
I have shortlisted some postcards for the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' which I want to share with you
Like this one is the post card of Riddhima Swargiyari from Guwahati
Assam
Riddhima is a student of class 7th
she has written that she wants to see an India in the 100th year of independence which is the cleanest country in the world
completely free of terrorism
included in the 100 percent literate countries
Zero accident country
and be capable of food security with sustainable technology
Riddhima
what our daughters think
the dreams they see for the country
do come true
When everyone's efforts come together
when your young generation will work towards this goal
you will definitely make India the way you want her to be
I have also got a post card of Navya Verma of Prayagraj
Uttar Pradesh
Navya has written that her dream for 2047 is of an India where everyone has a dignified life
where farmers are prosperous
there is no corruption.
Navya
your dream for the country is very commendable
The country is also moving rapidly in this direction
You talked about a corruption free India
Corruption hollows the country like a termite
Why wait for 2047 to get rid of it? All of us countrymen
today's youth have to do this work together
as soon as possible
for this it is very important that we give priority to our duties
Where duty is felt
Duty is paramount
corruption cannot even think of entering there.
Friends
in front of me is another postcard of Mohammed Ibrahim from Chennai
Ibrahim wants to see India as a major power in the field of defence in 2047
He wants that India should have its own research base on the Moon
and that India should start the work of settling the human population on Mars
Ibrahim also sees a big role for India in making the earth free from pollution
Ibrahim
nothing is impossible for a country that has youth like you.
Friends
I have another letter in front of me sent by Bhavna
a class 10th student of Saraswati Vidya Mandir in Raisen
Madhya Pradesh
First of all
I will say to Bhavna that I really liked the way you have decorated your postcard with the Tricolor
Bhavna has written about revolutionary Shirish Kumar.
Friends
I have also received Laurencio Pereira's postcard from Goa
She is a student of class 12th
The subject of her letter is also - Unsung Heroes of Freedom
I am sharing with you its essence in Hindi
She has written that Bhikaji Cama was one of the bravest women involved in the Indian freedom struggle
She carried out many campaigns in the country
abroad to empower daughters; organized many exhibitions
Certainly Bhikaji Cama was one of the most courageous women of the freedom movement
In 1907
she hoisted the Tricolor in Germany
The person who supported her in designing this Tricolor was Shri Shyamji Krishna Varma
Shri Shyamji Krishna Varma ji died in 1930 in Geneva
His last wish was that after India's independence
his ashes should be brought to India
Although his ashes should have been brought back to India on the very next day of independence in 1947
this did not happen
Maybe it was the wish of the Almighty to assign me this work..
and I was fortune to fulfil this duty
In the year 2003
when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat
his ashes were brought to India
A memorial has also been constructed in the memory of Shyamji Krishna Varma ji at his birth place
Mandvi in Kutch.
Friends
the enthusiasm of India’s Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav is not limited to our country
I have also received 75 postcards from Croatia
a friendly country of India
Students of the School of Applied Arts
Design in Zagreb
Croatia have sent these 75 cards to the people of India
congratulated them on the Amrit Mahotsav
On behalf of all countrymen
I thank Croatia
her people.
My dear countrymen
India has been the sacred land of education
knowledge
We have not confined education to bookish knowledge
but have seen it as a holistic experience of life
The great personalities of our country have also had a deep relationship with education
While Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya ji founded the Banaras Hindu University
Mahatma Gandhi played an important role in the establishment of Gujarat Vidyapeeth
There is a very lovely place in Anand
Gujarat – Vallabh Vidyanagar
On the insistence of Sardar Patel
two of his associates
Bhai Kaka
Bhikha Bhai
established education centres for the youth there
Similarly
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore established Shantiniketan in West Bengal
Maharaja Gaikwad was also one of the ardent supporters of education
He got many educational institutions built
inspired many personalities including Dr.Ambedkar
Shri Aurobindo for higher education
In the list of such great personalities
there is also the name of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh ji
Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh ji had handed over his house for the establishment of a technical school
He gave a lot of financial help for the construction of education centers in Aligarh
Mathura
Sometime back I also had the privilege of laying the foundation stone of a university in his name in Aligarh
I am happy that the same vibrant spirit of taking the light of education to the people continues in India even today
Do you know what is the most beautiful thing about this feeling? That is
this awareness about education is visible at every level in the society
The example of Taimmal ji living in Udumalpet block of Trippur district of Tamil Nadu is very inspiring
Taimmal ji does not have any land of her own
For years
her family is making a living by selling coconut water
The financial condition may not be good
but Taimmal ji had left no stone unturned to educate her son
daughter
Her children studied in Chinnaveerampatti Panchayat Union Middle School
One day in the meeting with the parents in the school
it was raised that the condition of the classrooms
school should be improved; the school infrastructure should be fixed
Taimmal ji was also in that meeting
She heard everything
In the same meeting
the discussion again came to a halt on the paucity of money for these works
After this
no one could have imagined what Taimmal did
Taimmal ji
who had accumulated some capital by selling coconut water
doanted one lakh rupees to the school.
Indeed
it takes a big heart
a sense of service
to do this
Taimmal ji says that in the school that is there has classes till 8th standard
Now when the infrastructure of the school improves
classes till higher secondary education will be held
This is the same sentiment I was talking about regarding education in our country
I have also come to know about a similar donation by an alumnus of IIT BHU
Jai Chaudhary
alumnus of BHU
donated one million dollars i.e
about seven
a half crores to IIT BHU Foundation.
Friends
in our country there are many people belonging to different fields
who are fulfilling their responsibility towards the society by helping others
I am very happy that such efforts are being seen continuously in the field of higher education especially in our different IITs
There is no dearth of such inspiring examples in Central Universities as well
To further enhance such efforts
from September last year
Vidyanjali Abhiyan has also been started in the country
Its objective is to improve the quality of education in schools across the country with the participation of various organizations
CSR
private sector
Vidyanjali is furthering the spirit of community participation
ownership
To be constantly connected with your school
college
to contribute something according to your ability
it is something whose fulfilment
joy can be felt only through experience.
My dear countrymen
love for nature
compassion for every living being
this is our culture as well as innate nature
A glimpse of these Sanskaras of ours was seen recently when a tigress left the world in Pench Tiger Reserve of Madhya Pradesh
People used to call this tigress collared tigress
The Forest Department named it T-15
The death of this tigress made people so emotional as if someone of their own had left the world
People performed her last rites
bid her farewell with full respect
affection
You must have also seen these pictures on social media
This love of Indians for nature
living beings was greatly appreciated the world over
The collared tigress gave birth to 29 cubs in her lifetime
raised 25 of them to maturity
We also celebrated this life of T-15
when she left the world
we also gave her a heartfelt farewell
This is the specialty of the people of India
We make a relationship of love with every conscious being
We also got to see a similar sight this time in the Republic Day parade as well
In this parade
the charger mount of the President's Bodyguard
Virat took part in his last parade
Horse Virat came to Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2003
used to lead the parade every time on Republic Day as Commandant Charger
Even when a foreign head of state was welcomed in Rashtrapati Bhavan
Virat used to play this role
This year
on Army Day
horse Virat was also given COAS Commendation Card by the Army Chief
In view of Virat's immense services
after his retirement he was given farewell in an equally grand manner.
My dear countrymen
when there is a sincere effort
work is done with a noble intention
results also follow
A great example of this has emerged from Assam
As soon as the name of Assam is taken
the thought of tea plantation
many national parks come to mind
Along with this
the picture of one horned rhinoceros i.e
one horn rhino also emerges in our mind
You all know that the one horned rhinoceros has always been a part of Assamese culture
This song of Bharat Ratna Bhupen Hazarika ji will resonate in every ear.
Friends
the meaning of this song is very relevant
This song says
the lush green surroundings of Kaziranga
the abode of elephants
tigers
the Earth watches one horned rhinoceros
listens to the melodious chirping of birds
The images of the rhinoceros are also seen in the Moonga
Eri dresses woven on the world famous handlooms of Assam
The rhinoceros
which has such great glory in the culture of Assam
also had to face difficulties
In 2013
37
in 2014
32 rhinos were killed by poachers
To tackle this challenge
a huge campaign against the poaching of rhinoceros was launched in the last seven years with the special efforts of the Assam government
On the 22nd of September last year
on the occasion of World Rhino Day
more than 2400 horns seized from smugglers were burnt
This was a stern message to the poachers
The result of such efforts is that now there is a steady decrease in the hunting of rhinos in Assam
Where 37 rhinos were killed in 2013
2 killings in 2020
only 1 in 2021 have come to the fore
I appreciate the resolve of the people of Assam to save the rhinoceros.
Friends
the diverse colours
spiritual strength of Indian culture have always attracted people from all over the world
If I tell you that Indian culture is very popular in America
Canada
Dubai
Singapore
Western Europe
Japan
you will find this very common; you will not be surprised
But
if I say that Indian culture has a big attraction in Latin America
South America too
you will definitely think once
Whether it is a matter of promoting Khadi in Mexico or an attempt to popularize Indian traditions in Brazil
we have discussed these topics earlier in 'Mann Ki Baat'
Today I will tell you about the Indian culture making its mark in Argentina
Our culture is very much liked in Argentina
In 2018
during my visit to Argentina
I participated in a yoga program – 'Yoga for Peace'
There is an organization in Argentina – Hastinapur Foundation
You will be surprised to hear..
whither Argentina..
and Hastinapur Foundation there too! This foundation is involved in the propagation of Indian Vedic traditions in Argentina
It was founded 40 years ago by a lady
Professor Aida Albrecht
Professor Aida Albrecht is going to turn 90 today
How her association with India happened is also very interesting
When she was 18 years old
she was first introduced to the power of Indian culture
She also spent a lot of time in India
She studied about Bhagavad Gita
Upanishads in depth
Today the Hastinapur Foundation has more than 40,000 members
about 30 branches in Argentina
other Latin American countries
Hastinapur Foundation has also published more than 100 Vedic
philosophical texts in Spanish language
Her ashram is also very enchanting
Twelve temples have been built in the ashram
in which there are idols of many Gods
Goddesses
There is also a temple at the center of all this which has been built for Advaitwadi Dhyan.
Friends
hundreds of such examples prove that our culture is a priceless heritage not only for us
but for the whole world
People all over the world want to know it
want to understand it
and want to live it
We should also try to make our cultural heritage a part of our life with full responsibility
try to take it to all the people.
My dear countrymen
I now want to ask a question to you
especially to our youth
Now imagine how many push-ups you can do at once
What I am about to tell you will surely fill you with wonder? Thounaojam Niranjoy Singh
a 24-year-old youth in Manipur
has made a record of 109 push-ups in a minute
Breaking the record is nothing new for Niranjoy Singh
earlier also
he had held the record for most Knuckle push-ups with one hand in a minute
I am sure you will be inspired by Niranjoy Singh
make physical fitness a part of your life.
Friends
today I want to share with you one such information about Ladakh which you will definitely be proud to know about
Ladakh will soon be blessed with an impressive Open Synthetic Track
Astro Turf Football Stadium
This stadium is being built at a height of more than 10,000 feet
its construction is going to be completed soon
This will be the largest open stadium in Ladakh where 30,000 spectators can sit together
This modern football stadium in Ladakh will also have a synthetic track with 8 lanes
Apart from this
there will also be a hostel facility with one thousand beds
You will also like to know that this stadium has also been certified by FIFA
the biggest organization of football
Whenever such a big sports infrastructure comes up
it brings great opportunities to the youth of the country
Alongwith such an arrangement
movement of people from all over the country takes place
tourism gets promoted
many employment opportunities are created
The stadium will also benefit many of our youth in Ladakh.
My dear countrymen
this time also in 'Mann Ki Baat' we touched upon many topics
There is one more topic
which is on everyone's mind at this time
that is of Corona
India is fighting with great success with the new wave of corona
it is also a matter of pride that till now about four
a half crore children have been administered the dose of Corona Vaccine
This means that about 60% of youth in the age group of 15 to 18 years have got their vaccines within three to four weeks
This will not only protect our youth but will also help them to continue with their studies
Another good thing is that within 20 days
one crore people have taken the precaution dose as well
This trust of our countrymen on the indigenous vaccine is our great strength
Now the cases of corona infection have also started decreasing - this is a very positive sign
People should be safe
the pace of economic activities of the country should be maintained - this is the wish of every countryman
And you already know
in 'Mann Ki Baat'
there are certain things
I cannot stay without mentioning..
like
we should not forget the'Swachhta Abhiyan' ; we should accelerate the campaign against single use plastic; Vocal for Local mantra is our responsibility
we have to work wholeheartedly for the Atma Nirbhar Bharat campaign
With the efforts of all of us
the country will reach new heights of development
With this wish
I bid you farewell
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen
Namaskar!
This is the 91st episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
Earlier we have talked about so many things
shared our views on myriad topics
but
this time 'Mann Ki Baat' is very special
The reason for this is Independence Day this time
when India will complete 75 years of her independence
We are all going to be witness to a splendid
historic moment
The Almighty has blessed us with this great fortune
Think about it… had we been born in the era of slavery
then how would have we imagined this day? That yearning of freedom from slavery
the desperation for freedom from the shackles of subjugation - how formidable it must have been! Those days
when
every single day
we would be seeing millions of countrymen fighting
battling
making sacrifices for the sake of freedom
Then we would wake up every morning with this dream of when my India would be free…
and maybe that day would dawn in our lives when we would dedicate our lives to the generations to come
chanting Vande Mataram
Bharat Maa Ki Jai
spending our youth for the cause.
Friends
on the 31st of July i.e
today
all of us countrymen salute the martyrdom of Shaheed Udham Singh ji
I offer my humble tributes to all such other great revolutionaries who sacrificed their all for the country.
Friends
I am very happy to see that the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is taking the form of a mass movement
People from all walks of life
from every section of the society are participating in different programs connected with it
One such event took place in Meghalaya earlier this month
People remembered the brave warrior of Meghalaya U
Tirot Singh on his death anniversary
Tirot Singh ji fiercely opposed the British conspiracy to control the Khasi Hills
destroy the culture there
Many artists gave beautiful performances in this program
They made history come alive
A carnival was also organized as part of the event
in which the great culture of Meghalaya was depicted in a beautiful manner
A few weeks ago
in Karnataka
a unique campaign named Amrita Bharathi Kannadarthi was also launched
In this
grand programs related to the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav were organized at 75 places in the state
In these
along with remembering the great freedom fighters of Karnataka
efforts were also made to bring to the fore the local literary achievements.
Friends
in this very July an interesting endeavour has been undertaken
named Azadi Ki Railgadi Aur Railway Station
The objective of this effort is to make people know the role of Indian Railways in the freedom struggle
There are many such railway stations in the country
which are associated with the history of the freedom movement
You too will be surprised to know about these railway stations
Gomoh Junction in Jharkhand is now officially known as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Junction Gomoh
Do you know why? Actually at this very station
Netaji Subhash was successful in dodging British officers by boarding the Kalka Mail
All of you must have heard the name of Kakori Railway Station near Lucknow
The names of bravehearts like Ram Prasad Bismil
Ashfaq Ullah Khan are associated with this station
The brave revolutionaries had displayed their might to the British by looting the treasury of the British being carried by train
Whenever you talk to the people of Tamil Nadu
you will get to know about Vanchi Maniyachchi Junction in Thoothukudi district
This station is named after Tamil freedom fighter Vanchinathan ji
This is the same place where Vanchi
25 years of age then
had punished one British collector for his actions.
Friends
this list is pretty long
75 such railway stations have been identified spread over 24 states across the country
These 75 stations are being decorated very ornately
Many types of programs are also being organized in these
You should also take out time to visit one such historical station in your vicinity
You will get to know in detail about pages from the history of the freedom movement that you have not been aware of
I urge the students of the nearby school
and the teachers to take the small children of their school to the station
narrate the whole chain of events to those children
explaining them.
My dear countrymen
under the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav
from the 13th to the 15th of August
a special movement – 'Har Ghar Tiranga- Har Ghar Tiranga' is being organized
By becoming a part of this movement
from August 13 to 15
you must hoist the tricolor at your home
or adorn your home with it
The Tricolor connects us
inspires us to do something for the country
I also have a suggestion that from the 2nd of August to the 15th of August
all of us can place the tricolor in our social media profile pictures
By the way
do you know
2nd of August also has a special connection with our tricolor
This day is the birth anniversary of Pingali Venkaiah ji who designed our national flag
I pay my respectful homage to him
Talking about our national flag
I will also remember the great revolutionary Madam Cama
Her role in shaping the Tricolor has been very important.
Friends
the biggest message that emerges from all these events being organized in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav is that all of us countrymen should follow our duty with full devotion
Only then will we be able to fulfill the dream of those countless freedom fighters…
to build the India of their dreams
That is why this Amrit Kaal of our next 25 years is Kartavyakaal
a period of duty for every countryman.
To liberate the country
our brave fighters had given us this responsibility
and we have to fulfill it fully.
My dear countrymen
the fight of our countrymen against Corona is still on
The whole world is still struggling today
The increasing interest of people in Holistic Healthcare has helped everyone a lot in this
We all know how useful Indian traditional methods are in this
In the fight against Corona
AYUSH has played an important role
at the global level
There is a growing interest in Ayurveda
Indian medicine around the world
This is one of the major reasons why Ayush Exports have witnessed a record growth
it is also a matter of joy that many new start-ups are also emerging in this sector
Recently
a Global Ayush Investment
Innovation Summit was held
You will be surprised to know that in this
investment proposals of about ten thousand crore rupees have been received
Another very important happening during the corona period is that
there has been a lot of increase in research on medicinal plants
Many research studies are being published on this
It is definitely a good start.
Friends
another great effort has been made in the country in the field of varied medicinal plants
herbs
The Indian Virtual Herbarium was just launched in the month of July
It is also an example of how we can use the digital world to connect with our roots
The Indian Virtual Herbarium is an interesting collection of digital images of preserved plants or plant parts
which is freely available on the web
More than one lakh Specimens
Scientific Information related to them are available on this Virtual Herbarium
In the Virtual Herbarium
a rich picture of the Botanical Diversity of India is also visible
I am sure the Indian Virtual Herbarium will become an important resource for research on Indian flora.
My dear countrymen
every time in 'Mann Ki Baat' we discuss successes of the countrymen which bring smiles to our faces
If a success story spreads sweet smiles
and also tastes sweet
you will certainly call it icing on the cake
These days our farmers are performing similar wonders in the production of honey
The sweetness of honey is also changing the lives of our farmers
increasing their income
In Yamunanagar
Harayana
there lives a beekeeper friend- Subhash Kamboj ji
Subhash ji underwent training in beekeeping in a scientific way
After that he started his work with just six boxes
Today he is engaged in beekeeping using about two thousand boxes
His honey is supplied across many states
Vinod Kumar ji is also beekeeping in more than one
a half thousand colonies in Palli village of Jammu
He has undertaken training in rearing the queen bee last year
Through this work
he is earning 15 to 20 lakh rupees annually
There is another farmer from Karnataka - Madhukeshwar Hegde ji
Madhukeshwar ji says that he had availed of subsidy from the Government of India for 50 bee colonies
Today he possesses over 800 colonies
and sells tons of honey
He brought in innovation in his work
and is also making botanical honey like Jamun honey
Tulsi honey
Amla honey
Madhukeshwar ji
your innovation
success in madhu
honey production also makes your name meaningful.
Friends
you all know how much importance has been given to honey in our traditional health science
In Ayurveda texts
honey has been described as an elixir
Honey
not only imparts taste ; it also gives us health
There are so many possibilities in honey production today that even the youth pursuing professional studies are making it a source of self-employment
One such youth is –Nimit Singh of Gorakhpur,U.P
Nimit ji has done B.Tech
His father is also a doctor
but after his studies
instead of a job
Nimit ji decided to be self-employed
He started honey production
He also got his own lab set up in Lucknow for quality check
Nimit ji is now earning well from honey
Bee Wax
and is also training farmers
going to different states
Due to the hard work of such youth
today the country is becoming such a big honey producer
You will be happy to know that the export of honey from the country has also increased
The country started campaigns like National Beekeeping
Honey Mission
farmers worked hard
and the sweetness of our honey started reaching across the world
There are still huge possibilities in this field
I would like our youth to join these opportunities
take advantage of them
realize new possibilities.
My dear countrymen
I have received a letter from a listener of 'Mann Ki Baat'
Shriman Ashish Bahl ji from Himachal Pradesh
He has mentioned in his letter the 'Minjar Mela' of Chamba
Actually
the inflorescence of the maize plant is called Minjar
When flowers bloom on the maize
Minjar Mela is also celebrated
in this fair
tourists from all over the country come from far
wide to take part
Incidentally
the Minjar fair is also going on at this time
If you have gone to visit Himachal
you can go to Chamba to see this fair.
“Chambe Ek Din Ona Kane Mahina Raina”
That is
those who come to Chamba for a day
they stay back here for a month seeing its beauty.
Friends
fairs have also been of great cultural importance in our country
Fairs connect people
hearts
When Kharif crops ripen after the rains in Himachal in September
in Shimla
Mandi
Kullu
Solan
Sari or Sair is also celebrated
Jagra is also going to arrive in September itself
In Jagra fairs
Bisu songs are sung after invoking the deity of Mahasu
This awakening of Mahasu Devta takes place in Himachal at Shimla
Kinnaur
Sirmaur; simultaneously in Uttarakhand.
Friends
there are many traditional fairs of tribal societies in different states in our country
Some of these fairs are associated with tribal culture
while some are organized in connection with tribal history
heritage
For example
if you get a chance
you must visit the four-day Samakka-Saralamma Jatara Fair in Medaram
Telangana
This fair is called Mahakumbh of Telangana
The Saralamma Jatara Mela is celebrated in honor of two tribal women heores – Samakka
Saralamma
It is a big center of faith for the Koya tribal community
not only in Telangana
but also in Chhattisgarh
Maharashtra
Andhra Pradesh
The Maridamma fair in Andhra Pradesh is also a big fair connected with the beliefs of the tribal society
The Maridamma fair runs from Jyeshtha Amavasya to Ashadh Amavasya
the tribal society here associates it with Shakti upasana
worship
Here
in Peddhapuram
East Godavari
there is also a Maridamma temple
Similarly
the people of Garasiya tribe in Rajasthan organize 'Siyawa ka Mela' or 'Mankhan Ro Mela' on Vaishakh Shukla Chaturdashi.
The 'Mawli Mela' of Narayanpur of Bastar in Chhattisgarh is also very special
Nearby
the Bhagoria Mela of Madhya Pradesh is also very famous
It is said that the Bhagoria fair started in the times of Raja Bhoj
Then the Bhil kings
Kasumara
Balun organized these events for the first time in their respective capitals
Ever since
these fairs are being celebrated with equal enthusiasm
Similarly
many fairs like Tarnetar
Madhopur are very famous in Gujarat
Fairs are
in themselves
a great source of energy for our society
our life
There must be many such fairs around you too
In modern times
these old links of the society are very important to strengthen the spirit of 'Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat'
Our youth must join them
whenever you go to such fairs
share the pictures on social media too
You can also use a specific hashtag if you want
Through this other people will also know about those fairs
You can also upload photos on the website of the Ministry of Culture
In the next few days
the Culture Ministry is going to start a competition
where
those who send the best pictures of the fairs will also be rewarded
So do not delay
visit the fairs
share their pictures
and maybe you will get rewarded too.
My dear countrymen
you must have noticed
in one episode of 'Mann Ki Baat' I had said that India has full potential to become a Powerhouse in Toys Exports
I had specially discussed the rich heritage of India in Sports
Games
The local toys of India are eco-friendly
consonant with both tradition
nature
Today I want to share with you the success of Indian Toys
Due to our Youngsters
Start-ups
Entrepreneurs
what our toy industry has achieved
the successes we have achieved
no one could have imagined
Today
when it comes to Indian toys
the echo of Vocal for Local is being heard everywhere
You will also like to know that now the number of toys coming from abroad in India is continuously decreasing
Earlier
where toys worth more than Rs 3 thousand crore used to come from outside
now their import has reduced by 70 percent
it is a matter of joy that during this period
India has exported toys worth more than two thousand six hundred crore rupees to foreign countries
Whereas earlier
only toys worth Rs 300-400 crore used to go out of India
And you already know that all this happened during the Corona period
India's toy sector has proven its mettle by transforming itself
Indian Manufacturers are now making toys based on Indian Mythology
History
Culture
Toy clusters that are there everywhere in the country
small entrepreneurs who make toys
are getting a lot of benefit from it
The toys made by these small entrepreneurs are now going around the world
Toy manufacturers from India are also working closely with the world's leading Global Toy Brands
I also liked that
our start-up sector is also paying full attention to the world of toys
They're also doing a lot of fun things in this area
In Bangalore
a start-up named Shumme Toys is focusing on eco-friendly toys
In Gujarat
Arkidzoo Company is making AR-based Flash Cards
AR-based Storybooks
Pune-based company
Funvention is engaged in kindling the interest of children in Science
Technology
Maths through Learning
Toys
Activity Puzzles
I congratulate all such manufacturers
Start-ups
doing a great job in the world of toys
Let us all together make Indian toys more popular all over the world
Along with this
I would also like to urge the parents to buy more
more Indian Toys
Puzzles
Games.
Friends
be it the classroom or the playground
today our youth
in every field
are making the country proud
This month
PV Sindhu has won her first title of Singapore Open
Neeraj Chopra also continued his excellent performance
won the silver medal for the country in the World Athletics Championship
At the Ireland Para Badminton International as well
our players have boosted the glory of the country by winning 11 medals
Indian players also performed well in the World Cadet Wrestling Championship held in Rome
Our athlete Suraj has done wonders in the Greco-Roman event
He has won the Gold Medal of Wrestling in this event after a long gap of 32 years
For the players
this entire month has been full of action
It is also a great honor for India to host the 44th Chess Olympiad in Chennai
This tournament has commenced on the 28th of July
I got the privilege of attending its Opening Ceremony
Commonwealth Games also began in the UK on the same day
An Indian team
full of youthful enthusiasm is representing the country there
I extend my best wishes to all the players
athletes on behalf of the countrymen
I am also happy that India is going to host the FIFA Under 17 Women's World Cup as well
This tournament will be held around October
which will enhance the enthusiasm of the daughters of the country towards sports.
Friends
a few days ago the results of class 10th
12th have also been declared across the country
I congratulate all those students who have achieved success through their hard work
dedication
Due to the pandemic
the last two years have been extremely challenging
The courage
restraint shown by our youth in these circumstances is highly commendable
I wish everyone a bright future.
My dear countrymen
today we started our discussion on 75 years of Independence
with a visit across the country
The next time we meet
the journey of our next 25 years would have already begun
We all have to join for our beloved tricolor to be hoisted at our homes
those of our loved ones
Do share with me how you celebrated Independence Day
if you did anything special
this time
Next time
we will talk again about the different colors of our Amrit Parv
Till then
I take leave of you
Thank you very much.
Hello my dear countrymen Namaskar! I have received many letters from all of you for 'Mann Ki Baat'; I have also received many messages on social media
NaMoApp
I am very thankful to you for that
In this program
it is our endeavour to discuss each other's inspiring efforts; to tell the story of change through mass movement to the entire country
In this episode
I want to discuss with you today one such mass movement of the country
that holds great importance in the life of every citizen of the country
But
before that I want to ask a question to the youth of today's generation
to the youth in the age group of 24-25 years
and the question is very serious… do ponder my question over
Did you know that when your parents were your age
once even their right to life was snatched away from them? You must be thinking how could have this happened? This is just impossible! But my young friends
this had happened once in our country
This took place years ago in 1975
It was the month of June when emergency was imposed
In that
all the rights were taken away from the citizens of the country
One amongst those rights was the 'Right to Life
Personal Liberty' provided to all Indians under Article 21 of the Constitution
At that time an attempt was made to crush the democracy of India
The country's courts
every constitutional institution
the press
were put under control
The condition of censorship was such that nothing could be printed without approval
I remember when famous singer Kishore Kumar refused to applaud the government
he was banned
His entry on the radio was done away with
But even after many attempts
thousands of arrests
and atrocities on lakhs of people
the faith of the people of India in democracy did not shake… not at all! For us
the people of India
the sanskars of democracy which we have been carrying on for centuries; the democratic spirit which is in our veins
finally won
The people of India got rid of the emergency
re-established democracy in a democratic way
It is difficult to find such an example of defeating a dictatorial mindset
a dictatorial tendency in a democratic way
in the whole world
During the Emergency
I had the good fortune to have been a witness; to be a partner in the struggle of the countrymen - as a soldier of democracy
Today
when the country is celebrating 75 years of its independence
celebrating Amrit Mahotsav
we should never forget that dreadful period of emergency
The generations to come should also not forget
The Amrit Mahotsav not only encompasses the victory saga of freedom from hundreds of years of slavery
but also the journey of 75 years after independence
We move forward
learning from every important stage of history.
My dear countrymen
there is hardly any of us who
in one’s life
has not had fantasies pertaining to the sky
During one’s childhood
stories of the moon
stars in the sky attract everyone
For the youth
touching the sky is synonymous with making dreams come true
Today
when our India is touching the sky of success in so many fields
how can the skies
or space
remain untouched by it! In the past few years
many big feats related to the space sector have been accomplished in our country
One of these achievements of the country has been the creation of an agency named In-Space… an agency that is promoting new opportunities in the space sector for the private sector of India
This beginning has especially attracted the youth of our country
I have received messages related to this from many young people.
A few days ago when I had gone to dedicate to the people the headquarters of In-Space
I saw the ideas
enthusiasm of many young start-ups
I also talked to them for a long time
You too will not be able to help being surprised when you learn about them
For example
take just the number
speed of space start-ups
Till a few years ago
in our country
in the space sector
no one even thought about start-ups
Today their number is more than a hundred
All these start-ups are working on ideas
which were either not thought about earlier
or were considered impossible for the private sector
For example
Chennai
Hyderabad have two start-ups – Agnikul
Skyroot! These start-ups are developing launch vehicles that will take small payloads into space
Through this
the cost of Space Launching is estimated to come down significantly
Similarly
Dhruva Space
another Start-Up of Hyderabad
is working on High Technology Solar Panels for Satellite Deployer
Satellites
I also met Tanveer Ahmed of Digantara
another space start-up who is trying to map waste in space
I have also given him a challenge that they should evolve work technology
which can solve the problem of waste in space
Both Digantara
Dhruva Space are going to make their first launch from ISRO's launch vehicle on the 30th of June
Similarly
Neha
the founder of Astrome
a space start-up based in Bangalore
is also working on an amazing idea
This start-up is making such flat antennas which will not only be small
but their cost will also be very low
Demand for this technology can be all over the world.
Friends
in the program of In-Space
I also met beti Tanvi Patel
a school student of Mehsana
She is working on a very small satellite
which is going to be launched in space in the next few months
Tanvi told me about her work very simply in Gujarati
Like Tanvi
about seven hundred
fifty school students in the country are working on 75 such satellites in the Amrit Mahotsav
and it is also a matter of joy that
most of these students are from small towns of the country.
Friends
these are the same youth
in whose mind the image of the space sector was like a secret mission a few years ago
but
the country undertook space reforms
and the same youth are now launching their own satellites
When the youth of the country is ready to touch the sky
how can our country be left behind?
My dear countrymen
in 'Mann Ki Baat'
let's now talk about a topic that will delight your mind
inspire you as well
Recently
our Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra was again in the headlines
Even after the Olympics
he is setting new records of success
one after the other
Neeraj won the silver at Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland
Not only that
He also broke the record of his own Javelin Throw
Neeraj once again made the country proud by winning the gold in Kuortane Games
He won this gold in conditions when the weather there was also inclement
This zest is the hallmark of today's youth
From Start-Ups to the Sports World
the youth of India are making new records
In the recently held Khelo India Youth Games too
our players set many records
You would love to know that a total of 12 records have been broken in these games - not only that
11 records have been registered in the names of female players
M
Martina Devi of Manipur has made eight records in weightlifting.
Similarly
Sanjana
Sonakshi
Bhavna have also made different records
With their hard work
these players have proven how much India's prestige is going to rise in international sports arena in the coming times
I also congratulate all these players
wish them all the best for the future.
Friends
there has been another special feature of Khelo India Youth Games
This time too many such talents have emerged
who are from very ordinary families
These players have struggled a lot in their lives to reach this stage of success
In their success
their family
and parents too
have had a big role to play.
Father of Adil Altaf from Srinagar
who won the gold in 70 km cycling
does tailoring work
but
has left no stone unturned to fulfill his son's dreams
Today Adil has brought pride to his father
the entire Jammu-Kashmir
Gold winner L
Dhanush’s father is a carpenter in Chennai
Sangli's daughter Kajol Sargar’s father works as a tea vendor
Kajol would help her father
practice weight lifting as well
This hard work of hers
her family paid off
Kajol has won a lot of accolades in weight lifting
Tanu of Rohtak has performed a similar kind of miracle
Tanu's father Rajbir Singh is a school bus driver in Rohtak
By winning the gold medal in wrestling
Tanu has realized her own
her family’s
her father’s dream.
Friends
in the sports world
now
the dominance of Indian players is increasing; at the same time
a new image of Indian sports is also emerging
For example
in Khelo India Youth Games
besides disciplines that are in Olympics
five indigenous sports
were also included this time
These five sports are – Gatka
Thang Ta
Yogasan
Kalaripayattu
Mallakhamb.
Friends
there is going to be an international tournament of a game which was born centuries ago in our own country…in India
This is the event of Chess Olympiad beginning from the 28th July
This time
more than 180 countries are participating in the Chess Olympiad
Today's discussion of sports
fitness cannot be complete without another name - this is the name of Telangana's mountaineer Poorna Malavath
By completeing the 7 summit challenge Poorna has added another feather in her cap of success
The seven summit challenge…that is the challenge of surmounting seven most difficult
highest mountain peaks
With her indomitable spirit
Purva ascended the highest peak of North America Mount Denali
brought honour to the counry
Poorna is the same daughter of India who had accomplished the amazing feat of done a conquering Mount Everest at the age of just 13.
Friends
when it comes to sports
today I would also like to discuss Mithali Raj
one of the most talented cricketers in India.
Just this month
she has announced her retirement from cricket which has emotionally moved many sports lovers
Mithali has not only been an extraordinary player
but has also been an inspiration to many players
I wish Mithali all the very best for her future.
My dear countrymen
in 'Mann Ki Baat' we have been discussing the successful efforts related to ‘waste to wealth’
One such example is that of Aizwal
the capital of Mizoram
There is a beautiful river 'Chitte Lui' in Aizwal
which due to neglect for years
had turned into a heap of dirt
garbage
Efforts have started in the last few years to save this river
For this
local agencies
voluntary organizations
local people
together
are also running the Save Chitte Lui action plan
This campaign of cleaning the river has also made an opportunity for wealth creation from waste
Actually
this river
its banks were full of plastic
polythene waste
The organization working to save the river
decided to build a road using this polythene
that is
the waste that came out of the river
From that
in a village in Mizoram
the state's first plastic road was built… that is cleanliness
development as well.
Friends
one such effort has also been undertaken by the youth of Puducherry through their voluntary organizations
Puducherry is situated along the sea coast
A large number of people come to see the beaches
marine beauty there
But
the pollution caused by plastic was also increasing on the sea coast of Puducherry
therefore
to save its sea
beaches
ecology
people here have started the 'Recycling for Life' campaign
Today
thousands of kilograms of garbage is collected
segregated every day in Karaikal
Puducherry
The organic waste from that is made into compost; the rest of the matter is separated
recycled
Such efforts are not only inspiring
but also lend momentum to India's campaign against single use plastic.
Friends
at this time when I am talking to you
a unique cycling rally is also going on in Himachal Pradesh
I want to tell you about this too
A group of cyclists have started from Shimla to Mandi carrying the message of cleanliness
These people will complete this distance of about one hundred
seventy five kilometers on mountain roads
only by cycling
There are children as well as the elderly in this group
If our environment is clean
our mountains
rivers
our seas remain clean; our health also gets better
You must keep writing me about such efforts.
My dear countrymen
monsoon is continuously progressing in our country
Rain is increasing in many states
This is also the time to make special efforts in the direction of 'water'
'water conservation'
In our country
for centuries
this responsibility has been taken by the society together
You will remember
in 'Mann Ki Baat' we once discussed the legacy of step wells
The Baolis are those big wells which are reached by descending stairs
In Udaipur
Rajasthan
there is one such stepwell which is hundreds of years old - 'Sultan Ki Baoli'
It was built by Rao Sultan Singh
but due to neglect
gradually this place has become deserted
has turned into a pile of garbage
One day some youths roaming around reached this stepwell
were very sad to see its condition
At that very moment these youths resolved to change the picture
destiny of Sultan Ki Baoli
They named this mission of their - 'Sultan se Sur-Tan'
You must be wondering
what is this ‘Sur Tan! In fact
with their efforts
these youths have not only rejuvenated the step well
but have also linked it to the notes
melody of the music
After cleaning the Sultan's stepwell
after decorating it
takes place a program of harmony
music
There is so much talk of this change
that many people from abroad have started coming to see it
The most important thing about this successful effort is that the youth who started the campaign are chartered accountants
Coincidentally
a few days from now
July 1 is observed as chartered accountants day
I congratulate all the CAs of the country in advance
We can create a similar sense of awareness about our water bodies by connecting them with music
other social programs
Water conservation is actually life conservation
You must have seen
nowadays
how many 'river festivals' are being held! Whichever water sources are there in your cities
you must organize one event or the other.
My dear countrymen
our Upanishads mention about a life mantra- ‘Charaiveti-Charaiveti-Charaiveti’- you must have heard this mantra too
It means – keep going
keep going
This mantra is so popular in our country because it is part of our nature to keep moving
to be dynamic; to keep moving
As a nation
we have come this far through a journey of development spanning thousands of years
As a society
we have always moved ahead by accepting new ideas
new changes
Our cultural mobility
travels have contributed a lot in this
That is why our sages
saints had entrusted us with spiritual responsibilities like pilgrimage
All of us go on varied pilgrimages
You must have seen that this time a large number of devotees participated in the Chardham Yatra
In our country
from time to time
different Dev-yatras also take place
Dev Yatras… that is
in which not only the devotees but also our Gods go on a journey
In just a few days from now on the 1st of July
the famous journey of Lord Jagannath is going to commence
All of us are familiar with the Puri yatra in Odisha
People make efforts to ensure that on this occasion they get the good fortune of going to Puri
In other states too
Jagannath Yatras are taken out with great gaiety
fervour
Bhagwan Jagannath Yatra begins on Dwitiya
the second day of the month of Ashadha
In our texts 'Ashadhasya Dwitiya divase..
Rath Yatra'
this is how the description is found in Sanskrit shlokas
In Ahmedabad
Gujrat too
every year Rath Yatra begins from Ashadh Dwitiya
I was in Gujarat
so I also used to get the privilege of serving in this Yatra every year
Ashadha Dwitiya
also known as Ashadhi Bij
marks the beginning of the new year of Kutch on this day
I also wish Happy New Year to all my Kutchi brothers
sisters
For me this day is also very special - I remember
a day before Ashadha Dwitiya
that is
on the first Tithi of Ashadha
we started a Sanskrit festival in Gujarat
which comprises songs
music
cultural programs in Sanskrit language
The name of this event is – 'Ashadhasya Pratham Diwase'
There is also a reason behind giving this special name to the festival
Actually
the great Sanskrit poet Kalidas wrote the Meghdootam on the arrival of rain from the month of Ashadh
There is a verse in Meghdootam – Ashadhasya Pratham Diwase
Megham Ashlishta Sanum
that is
mountain peaks covered with clouds on the first day of Ashadha
this verse became the basis of this event.
Friends
be it Ahmedabad or Puri
Lord Jagannath also gives us many deep human messages through this journey
Bhagwan Jagannath is the lord of the world
but the poor
downtrodden have a special participation in his journey
God also walks along with every section
person of the society
Similarly
in all the journeys that take place in our country
there is no such distinction between poor
rich
high
low
Rising above all discrimination
the journey itself is paramount
As you must have heard about the Yatra of Pandharpur in Maharashtra...
In the Pandharpur Yatra
one is neither big nor small
Everyone is a Varkari
a servant of Bhagwan Vitthal
Just 4 days later,the Amarnath Yatra is also going to start from the 30th of June
Devotees from all over the country reach Jammu Kashmir for the Amarnath Yatra
The local people of Jammu Kashmir take the responsibility of this Yatra with equal reverence
and cooperate with the pilgrims.
Friends
the Sabarimala Yatra has the same importance in the South
This pilgrimage to seek Darshan of Bhagwan Ayyappa on the hills of Sabarimala has been going on from the times when this path was completely surrounded by forests
Even today
when people go on these yatras
how many opportunities are created for the poor… from religious rituals to lodging arrangements… that is
these yatras directly give us an opportunity to serve the poor
are equally beneficial to them
That is why the country
too
is now making many efforts to increase the facilities for the devotees in their spiritual journeys
If you too go on such a journey
you will also have a glance of Ek Bharat- Shreshtha Bharat along with spirituality.
My dear countrymen
as always
this time also it was a very pleasant experience to connect with all of you through 'Mann Ki Baat'
We discussed the successes
achievements of the countrymen
In the midst of all this
we also have to take precautions against Corona
However
it is a matter of satisfaction that today the country has a comprehensive protective shield of a vaccine
We have reached close to 200 crore vaccine doses
Precaution dose is also being rapidly administered in the country
If it is time for a precaution dose after your second dose
then you must take this third dose
Make your family members
especially the elderly
take a precautionary dose
We also have to take necessary precautions like hand hygiene
masks
We also have to be alert of the diseases caused by the surrounding filth during the rainy season
All of you stay alert
stay healthy
keep moving forward with similar positive energy
We'll meet again next month
until then
many many thanks
Namaskar!
My dear countrymen
Namaskar! Last week we achieved a feat that filled all of us with pride
You must have heard that last week
India has achieved the export target of $ 400 billion
i.e
30 lakh crore rupees
At first instance
it might come across as a matter related to the economy; but more than the economy
it is related to the capability of India
the potential of India
At one time
the figure of exports from India used to be 100 billion
at times 150 billion
sometimes 200 billion…today
India has reached 400 billion dollars
In a way
this means that the demand for items made in India is increasing all over the world; the other meaning is that the supply chain of India is getting stronger by the day…
it also has a very big message
The nation takes great strides when resolves are bigger than dreams
When there is a sincere effort day
night for the resolves
those resolutions also attain fruition…
you see
the same happens in a person's life as well
When one's resolve
one’s efforts
become bigger than one’s dreams
success comes to the person on its own.
Friends
new
ever new products from all corners of the country are reaching foreign shores
Leather products from Hailakandi in Assam or handloom products from Osmanabad
fruits
vegetables from Bijapur or black rice from Chandauli
the exports of all of these are increasing
Now
you will also find the world famous apricot of Ladakh in Dubai too
in Saudi Arabia
you will find bananas shipped from Tamil Nadu
Most importantly
an array of new products are being sent to ever newer countries
For example
the first consignment of millets grown in Himachal
Uttarakhand was exported to Denmark
Bainganapalli
Subarnarekha mangoes from Krishna
Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh were exported to South Korea
Fresh jackfruits from Tripura were exported to London by air
for the first time King Chilli from Nagaland was dispatched to London
Similarly
the first consignment of Bhalia wheat was exported from Gujarat to Kenya
Sri Lanka
This means
now if you go to other countries
Made in India products will be more visible than ever before.
Friends
this list is very long
the power of Make In India is equivalent in might to the extent of the list
Equally great is the potential of India…
the basis of its strength are our farmers
artisans
our weavers
engineers
our small entrepreneurs
the MSME sector; people from many different professions
all of them are its true strength
It is only due to their hard work
that the goal of exporting to the tune of $ 400 billion has been achieved
I am happy that this power of the people of India is now reaching new markets in every nook
corner of the world
When each
every Indian is vocal for local
it does not take long for the local to become global
Let's make the local ‘global’
augment the prestige of our products further.
Friends
the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' will love to know that the success of our small entrepreneurs at the domestic level also makes us proud
Today our small entrepreneurs are playing a major partnership role in government procurement through Government e-Market place i.e
GeM
A much transparent system has been developed through technology
During the last one year through the GeM portal
the government has purchased items worth more than one lakh crore rupees
Close to 1.25 lakh small entrepreneurs
small shopkeepers from every corner of the country have sold their goods directly to the government
There was a time when only big companies could sell goods to the government
However
the country is changing now; the old systems are also changing
Now even the smallest of shopkeepers can sell one’s goods to the government on the GeM Portal – this is the New India
She not only dreams big
but also shows the courage to reach that goal
where no one has reached before
On the basis of this very courage
all of us Indians together will definitely fulfill the dream of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat
a self-reliant India.
My dear countrymen
you must have observed Baba Sivanand ji in the recently held Padma Awards ceremony
Seeing the agility of the 126-year-old
everyone must have been surprised just like I was…and I saw
before one could bat an eyelid
he started bowing in the Nandi Mudra
I bowed a number of times
offered Pranaam to Baba Sivanand ji
Both
the age of 126 years
the fitness of Baba Sivanand are the subject of discussion in the country today
I read many people's comments on social media
that Baba Sivanand is fitter than those one-fourth his age
Indeed
the life of Baba Sivananda is an inspiration for all of us
I wish him a long life
He has a passion for yoga
leads a very healthy lifestyle.
जीवेम शरदः शतम् |
In our culture
everyone is wished a hundred years of healthy life
We will celebrate 'World Health Day' on the 7th of April
Today
the collective Indian thought on health
whether it is Yoga or Ayurveda
is increasingly trending all over the world
Just last week you must have noticed a Yoga program being organized in Qatar
In this
citizens of 114 countries participated
made a new world record
Similarly
the market of the Ayush Industry is also increasing continuously
6 years ago
the market for medicines related to Ayurveda was around 22 thousand crores
Today
the Ayush Manufacturing Industry is reaching around one lakh forty thousand crore rupees
that is
the possibilities are increasing continuously in this sector
In the start-up world too
AYUSH is becoming a subject of attraction.
Friends
I have often referred to earlier on other start-ups of the health sector
but this time I will talk to you especially on Ayush Start-Ups
There is a start-up Kapiva! Its meaning is hidden in its name
Here
Ka means - Kapha
Pi means - Pitta
Va means - Vaata
This Start-Up is based on healthy eating habits in accordance with our traditions
Nirog-Street too is another start-up which is a unique concept in the Ayurveda Healthcare Ecosystem
Its technology-driven platform connects Ayurveda Doctors from across the world directly to the people
More than 50 thousand practitioners are associated with it
Similarly
Atreya Innovations
a healthcare technology start-up
is working in the field of Holistic Wellness
Ixoreal has not only spread awareness about the use of Ashwagandha
but has also invested a huge amount on top-quality production process
Cureveda has created dietary supplements for Holistic Life through the confluence of modern herbal research
traditional knowledge.
Friends
I have listed only a few names so far; this list is very long
It is a symbol of the young entrepreneurs of India
the new possibilities being created in India
I also have a request for the Start-Ups of the Health Sector
especially the Ayush Start-Ups
Whatever portal you design online; whatever content you create
try to make it in all the languages recognized by the United Nations
There are many such countries in the world where English is neither spoken nor understood much
Promote your information keeping such countries in mind as well
I am sure that soon
Ayush Start-Ups from India with better quality products will reign all over the world.
Friends
health is also directly related to cleanliness
In 'Mann Ki Baat'
we always mention the efforts of the proponents of cleanliness
One such Swachhagrahi is Chandrakishore Patil ji
He lives in Nashik
Maharashtra
Chandrakishore ji's resolve regarding cleanliness is very heartfelt
He stands by the Godavari river
and constantly encourages people not to throw garbage in the river
If he sees someone doing this
he immediately stops them
Chandrakishore ji invests a lot of his time in this endeavour
By evening
he has a pile of such things
which people have brought to throw into the river
This effort of Chandrakishore ji also raises awareness
is also inspiring
Similarly
there is another Swachhagrahi – Rahul Maharana of Puri in Orissa
Rahul goes to the pilgrimage sites in Puri early in the morning every Sunday
and clears the plastic garbage there
He has cleaned hundreds of kilos of plastic garbage
dirt so far
Be it Rahul of Puri or Chandrakishore of Nashik
they teach us a lot
As citizens
we must carry out our duties
whether it is cleanliness
nutrition or vaccination… all these efforts also help us in staying healthy.
My dear countrymen
let's talk about Mupattam Sri Narayanan ji of Kerala
He has started a project named - 'Pots for water of life'
When you come to know about this project
you will marvel at the wonderful work done.
Friends
Mupattam Sri Narayanan ji is running a campaign to distribute earthen pots so that animals
birds do not face water problems during summer
In summer
he used to get upset seeing the plight of animals
birds
Then he thought… why not start distributing earthen pots himself so that others were left with only the task of filling water in those pots
You will be surprised that the number of utensils distributed by Narayanan ji is going to cross one lakh
In his campaign
he will donate the hundred thousandth pot to the Sabarmati Ashram established by Gandhi ji
Today
when the summer season has knocked at our doors
this work of Narayanan will definitely inspire all of us
we will also make arrangements for water for our animal
bird friends this summer.
Friends
I would also request the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' to reiterate our resolves
Whatever we can do to save every drop of water
we must do that
Apart from this
we have to keep giving equal emphasis on recycling of water
The water used at home can be used in pots
can be used in gardening
it must be reused
With a little effort
you can make such arrangements in your home
Centuries ago
Rahimdas ji had purposefull said 'Rahiman paani raakhiye
bin paani sab soon'
And in this task of saving water
I have high hopes from children
Just as our children made cleanliness a movement
they can help save water by becoming a 'Water Warriors'.
Friends
for centuries
water conservation in our country; protection of water sources has been part of the nature of society
I am happy that many people in the country have made water conservation a life mission
Like Arun Krishnamurthy is a friend from Chennai! Arun ji is running a campaign to clean the ponds
lakes in his area
He took up the responsibility of cleaning more than 150 ponds
lakes
successfully completed it
Similarly
there is a friend from Maharashtra
Rohan Kale
Rohan is an HR Professional
He is running a campaign to preserve hundreds of step wells in Maharashtra
Many of these wells are centuries old
are part of our heritage
Bansilal-Pet Kuan in Secunderabad is one such step well
Due to years of neglect
this step well got filled with mud
garbage
But now the campaign to revive this step well has started with public participation.
Friends
I hail from a state where there has always been a shortage of water
These step wells are called Vav in Gujarat
Vav has played a big role in a state like Gujarat
The 'Jal Mandir Scheme' played a significant role in the protection of these wells or step wells
Several step wells were revived all over Gujarat
This also helped a lot in raising the water level in these areas
You can also run similar campaigns at the local level
Be it the construction of Check dams or Rain Water Harvesting
individual efforts are also important in this
collective efforts are necessary too
For instance
at least 75 Amrit Sarovars can be made in every district of our country in the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav
Some old lakes can be rejuvenated; some new ones can be dug
I am sure you will definitely make some effort in this direction.
My dear countrymen
one of the beautiful aspects of 'Mann Ki Baat' is that I get your messages in many languages
in many dialects
Many people also send audio message on MYGOV
India's culture
our languages
our dialects
our way of life
our culinary range
all of this diversity is our great strength
From east to west
from north to south
this diversity binds India together
leading to Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat
Here too
both our historical sites
Pauranik literature contribute a lot
You must be wondering why I am mentioning this to you right now! The reason for this is the "Madhavpur Mela"
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat will find it very interesting to know where the Madhavpur Mela is held
why it is held
how it is related to the diversity of India.
Friends
"Madhavpur Mela" is held in the village of Madhavpur near the sea at Porbandar in Gujarat
But it also connects with the eastern end of India
You must be thinking how this is possible! The answer to this also comes from a Pauranik story
It is said that thousands of years ago Lord Krishna was married to Rukmani
a princess from the North East
This marriage took place in Madhavpur
Porbandar
as a symbol of the that marriage
even today Madhavpur fair is held there
This deep relationship between the East
West is our heritage
With the passage of time with the efforts of the people
new aspects too are now being added to the Madhavpur fair
In local parlance
the bride’s side is called Gharati
now many Gharaatis from the North East have started coming to this fair
Artists from all the states of the North East reach the Madhavpur Fair
which lasts for a week; when artisans associated with handicrafts arrive
the beauty of the fair is enhanced manifold
For a week
this amalgamation of cultures of the East
West of India
the Madhavpur fair creates a very beautiful example of Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat
I request you to read
know more about this fair as well.
My dear countrymen
the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav in the country is now becoming a new example of public participation
A few days ago
on the 23rd of March
many celebrations were held in different corners of the country on Martyrs' Day
The country remembered te heroes
heroines of her Independence; remembered them reverently
On the same day I also got the opportunity to dedicate to the nation the Biplobi Bharat Gallery at Victoria Memorial
Kolkata
This is a very unique gallery to pay tribute to the brave revolutionaries of India
If you get n opportunity
you must certainly visit it
Friends
in the month of April we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of two great personalities
Both of them have left their deep impact on Indian society
These great personalities are - Mahatma Phule
Babasaheb Ambedkar
We will celebrate Mahatma Phule's birth anniversary on the 11th of April
Babasaheb's birth anniversary on the 14th of April
Both of these great men fought persistently against discrimination
inequality
Mahatma Phule opened schools for girls in that era; raised his voice against female infanticide
He also launched large campaigns to get rid of the water crisis.
Friends
the mention of Savitribai Phule ji is equally important in this reference to Mahatma Phule
Savitribai Phule played a significant role in the formation of many social institutions
As a teacher
a social reformer
she also made the society aware
encouraged it
Together they founded the Satyashodhak Samaj…they made efforts for the empowerment of the people
We can clearly see the influence of Mahatma Phule in the work of Babasaheb Ambedkar
He also used to say that the development of any society can be assessed by looking at the status of women in that society
Taking inspiration from the life of Mahatma Phule
Savitribai Phule
Babasaheb Ambedkar
I request all the parents
guardians to ensure education for their daughters
In order to increase the enrollment of daughters in schools
the Kanya Shiksha Pravesh Utsav has also been started a few days ago… the focus is on bringing back to school those girls who missed their studies for some reason.
Friends
it is a matter of good fortune for all of us that we have also got an opportunity to work for Panch Teerth associated with Babasaheb
Be it his birthplace in Mhow
Chaityabhoomi in Mumbai
his home in London
the Deeksha Bhoomi in Nagpur
or Babasaheb's Maha-Parinirvana Sthal in Delhi
I have had the privilege of visiting all the places
all sacred sites
I would urge the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' to visit the places associated with Mahatma Phule
Savitribai Phule
Babasaheb Ambedkar
You will get to learn a lot there.
My dear countrymen
this time too in 'Mann Ki Baat' we talked on many topics
Many festivals are lined up next month
Navratri is only a few days away
In Navratri
we practice fasting
perform sadhana of Shakti
worship Shakti…that is
our traditions teach us celebration
restraint as well
Sanyam
Tap are also a festival for us
which is why Navratri has always been very special for all of us
There is also the festival of Gudi Padwa on the very first day of Navratri
Easter also comes in April
the holy days of Ramadan are also starting
Let us celebrate our festivals by including everyone together
strenthening India's diversity… this is our collective desire
That’s all this time in 'Mann Ki Baat'
I will see you again next month with new topics.
Many many thanks !
My dear countrymen
Namaskar!
Today once again through 'Mann Ki Baat' I have got an opportunity to meet you all; millions of my family members
I welcome all of you to 'Mann Ki Baat'
A few days ago
the country has made an achievement
which inspires all of us… instills a new confidence in India's prowess
You must be feeling happy on hearing of the century of a batsman of Team India on the cricket field
But
India has scored a century in another field
it is very special
On the 5th of this month
the number of unicorns in the country has reached the figure of 100
you surely know that a unicorn is a start-up worth at least seven
a half thousand crore rupees
The total valuation of these Unicorns is more than 330 billion dollars
that is
more than 25 lakh crore rupees
Certainly
this is a matter of pride for every Indian
You will also be surprised to know that out of our total unicorns
forty four came up last year
Not only that
14 more Unicorns were formed anew in 3-4 months this year
This means that even in this phase of the global pandemic
our start-ups have been creating wealth
value
The average annual growth rate of Indian Unicorns is more than those of USA
UK
many other countries
Analysts also say that in the coming years there will be a sharp spike in these numbers
The good thing is that our Unicorns are diversifying
They are operating in many fields like E-commerce
Fin-Tech
Ed-Tech
Bio-Tech
Another thing which I consider more important is that the world of start-ups is reflecting the spirit of New India
Today
India's start-up ecosystem is not limited to just big cities; entrepreneurs are emerging from smaller cities
towns as well
This shows that in India
the one who has an innovative idea
can create wealth.
Friends
behind this success of the country
the youth-power of the land
the talent
the government here
all are putting in efforts together… everyone is contributing
But
another thing that is important in the world of Start-Ups is
right mentoring
that is
right guidance
A good mentor can take a start-up to new heights… can guide the founders in every way toward the right decision
I am proud that there are many such mentors in India who have dedicated themselves to promote Start-ups.
Sridhar Vembu ji has recently received the Padma Award
He himself is a successful entrepreneur
but now he has also taken up upon himself the task of grooming other entrepreneurs
Shridhar ji has started his work from a rural area
He is encouraging the rural youth to do something in this area
staying in the village itself
We also have people like Madan Padaaki who had created a platform named One-Bridge in 2014 to promote rural entrepreneurs
Today
One-Bridge is present in more than 75 districts of southern
eastern India
More than 9000 rural entrepreneurs associated with it are providing their services to rural consumers
Meera Shenoy ji is also one such example
She is doing remarkable work in the field of Market Linked Skills Training for rural
tribal
disabled youth
I have mentioned only a few names here
but today there is no dearth of mentors among us
It is a matter of great happiness for us that today a complete support system is evolving in the country for start-ups
I am sure that in the times to come
we will get to see a new flight of progress in the start-up world of India.
Friends
a few days ago I found an interesting
attractive thing which is full of colours of the creativity of the countrymen
their artistic talent
It is a gift sent to me by Self-Help Group from Thanjavur
Tamil Nadu
This gift bears the fragrance of Indianness
the blessings of Matri-Shakti – a glimpse of her affection for me
This is a special Thanjavur Doll
which also has a GI Tag
I offer special thanks to the Thanjavur Self-Help Group for sending me this gift imbued in the local culture
In a way
friends
this Thanjavur Doll besides being beautiful that it is
is also scripting a new saga of women empowerment
Women's Self-Help Groups stores
kiosks are also opening up in Thanjavur
Because of this
the lives of many poor families have changed
With the help of such kiosks
stores
women are now able to sell their products directly to the customers
The initiative has been named 'Tharagaigal Kaivinai Porutkal Virpanai Angadi'
The special thing is that 22 Self-Help Groups are associated with this initiative
You would also be happy to know that these stores of Women Self Help Groups have opened at very prime locations in Thanjavur
Women themselves are taking full responsibility of their upkeep as well
Apart from GI products like Thanjaur Doll
Bronze Lamp 
these women Self Help Groups
also craft toys
mats
artificial jewellery
Due to such stores
the sales of GI products as well as handicraft products have seen a significant rise
Through this campaign
not only have the artisans got a fillip
but the women are also getting empowered by a rise in their income
I also urge the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat'… find out which Women Self Help Groups are working in your area
You should also collect information about their products
use these products as much as possible
By doing this
you will not only help in increasing the income of the Self Help Groups
but will also give impetus to the 'Self-reliant India Campaign'.
Friends
our country is a rich treasure house of many languages
scripts
dialects
Varied attire
cuisine
culture in different regions is our hallmark
As a nation this diversity strengthens us
keeps us united
I wish to share with all of you a very inspiring example related to this
which is that of beti Kalpana
Her name is Kalpana
but her endeavor is full of the true spirit of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'
Actually
Kalpana has recently passed her class 10th examination in Karnataka
but
the very special thing about her success is that
Kalpana did not know Kannada language till some time ago
She not only learned Kannada language in three months
but also proved it by scoring 92 marks
You might be surprised to know this
but it is true
There are many other things about her that will amaze you
will also inspire you
Kalpana is originally from Joshimath in Uttarakhand
She had been suffering from TB earlier
when she was in the class three she lost her eyesight too
but
as they say
'where there is a will
there is a way'
Kalpana later came in contact with Professor Taramurthy
a resident of Mysuru
who not only encouraged her but also helped her in every way
Today
through her hard work
she has set an example for all of us
I congratulate Kalpana for her fortitude
Similarly
there are many people in our country who are working towards strengthening the linguistic diversity of the country
One such friend Shripati Tudu ji hails from Purulia in West Bengal
Tudu ji is a professor of Santhali language at Sidho-Kaano-Birsa University
Purulia
He has prepared a version of the country's Constitution in his native 'Ol Chiki' script for the Santhali community
Shripati Tudu ji asserts that our Constitution makes every citizen of our country aware of one’s rights
duties
Therefore
it is important for every citizen to be familiar with it
Therefore
he prepared a copy of the constitution in his own script for the Santhali community
offered it as a gift
I appreciate this thinking of Shripati ji
his efforts
This is a living example of the spirit of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'
You will also find information about many such efforts furthering this spirit
on the website of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'
Here you will get to know about activities on many such subjects including food
art
culture
tourism
You can also take part in these activities
this will give you information about your country
and you will also experience the diversity of the country.
My dear countrymen
the holy pilgrimage of 'Char-Dham' in Uttarakhand is currently underway in our country
Thousands of devotees are reaching every day at 'Char-Dham'
especially in Kedarnath
People are sharing happy experiences of their 'Char-Dham Yatra'
But
I have also seen that some devotees are also very sad because of the filth being spread by some pilgrims in Kedarnath
Many people have expressed their views on social media as well
Going on a holy pilgrimage
coming across a heap of filth there is not right
But friends
in the midst of these complaints
one is getting to see many good pictures too
Where there is faith
there is also creation
positivity
There are many devotees who are worshiping in the Dham of Baba Kedar
as well as performing the sadhna of cleanliness
Some are cleaning near the place of stay
while others are cleaning garbage along the travel route
Many organizations
voluntary organizations are also working there along with the Swachh Bharat campaign team
Friends
just as a pilgrimage is important here; equally important is ‘teertha sewa’ as has been mentioned
I would also say that without ‘teertha sewa’
a pilgrimage is also incomplete
There are many people in Devbhoomi Uttarakhand who are engaged in the ‘sadhana’ of cleanliness
service
You will be greatly inspired by Shriman Manoj Bainjwal hailing form Rudra Prayag
For the last 25 years
Manoj ji has taken it upon himself to look after the environment
Apart from running the campaign of cleanliness
he is also engaged in making holy places plastic free
While
Surendra Bagwadi ji hailing from Guptkashi has also made cleanliness his life mantra
In Guptkashi
he regularly runs cleanliness programmes
and
I have learned that he has also named this campaign as 'Mann Ki Baat'
Similarly
Champa Devi from village Devar has been teaching waste management to women of the village
Champa ji has planted hundreds of trees
through sheer hard work she has set up a stretch of forest full of greenery
Friends
through the efforts of such people the divinity of Dev Bhoomi
holy places has been maintained…We go there to experience it
so it is our responsibility to maintain this divinity
spirituality
Along with 'Chardham Yatra' in our country
there will be many yatras like 'Amarnath Yatra'
'Pandharpur Yatra'
'Jagannath Yatra' in the coming times
In the month of Sawan
some fair or the other is held
perhaps in every village.
Friends
wherever we go
let us maintain the dignity of these pilgrimage sites
Purity
cleanliness
a pious environment… we should never forget these
for that
it is imperative that we abide by the resolution of cleanliness
A few days later
the world will celebrate the 5th of June as ‘Environment Day'
We should run positive environment campaigns around us
this is a never ending task
This time
you should join everyone together – you should certainly make some effort for cleanliness
tree plantation
Plant a tree yourself
inspire others too.
My dear countrymen
next month on the 21st of June
we are going to celebrate the 8th 'International Yoga Day'
This time the theme of 'Yoga Day' is - Yoga for Humanity
I would urge all of you to celebrate 'Yoga Day' with great enthusiasm
Yes! Also take precautions related to corona
By the way
the situation now is looking better than earlier across the whole world
On account of more
more vaccination coverage
people now are going out more than ever; therefore
a lot of preparations are also being seen all over the world for 'Yoga Day'
The corona pandemic has made all of us realize the overarching importance of health in our lives
Yoga being a great medium in ensuring the same
People are experiencing how much physical
spiritual
intellectual well being is receiving a boost through Yoga
From the world's top business persons to film
sports personalities
from students to common people
everyone is making yoga an integral part of one’s life
I do believe that witnessing the increasing popularity of Yoga across the world must be making you happy
Friends
this time I have come to know about some very innovative examples being held on 'Yoga Day' in the country
abroad
One of these is Guardian Ring - it will be a very unique programme
In this
the Movement of the Sun will be celebrated
that is
as the sun travels
we will welcome it through yoga from different parts of the earth
Indian missions in different countries will organize yoga programs at sunrise according to the local time there
The program will successively commence
following one country after another
The journey from east to west will go on continuously…and on these lines
it will proceed accordingly
Streaming of these programs will also be linked one after the other
that is
it will be a kind of relay Yoga streaming event
Do watch it.
Friends
this time keeping in mind the 'Amrit Mahotsav' in our country
'International Yoga Day' will also be organized at 75 major places in the country
On this occasion
many organizations
countrymen are preparing to do something innovative at their own level
in their respective fields
I would urge you also this time to celebrate Yoga Day
choose any place in your city
town or village which is most special
This place can be an ancient temple
tourist center
or it could be the banks of a famous river
lake or pond
With this
along with yoga
the identity of your area will also be reinforced
tourism there will also get a boost
At present
the 100 day countdown leading to 'Yoga Day'
is also underway; rather
programs based on personal
social efforts
have already begun three months ago
On these lines
there have been countdown programs of 100th day
75th day in Delhi
Similarly
50th Countdown Events were organized in Sivasagar
Assam
25th in Hyderabad
I wish you should also start preparations for 'Yoga Day' on your own right now
Meet more
more people
urge everyone to join the program of 'Yoga Day'; inspire them
I am sure that all of you will participate enthusiastically in the 'Yoga Day'
as well as adopt yoga in your daily life.
Friends
a few days ago I had gone to Japan
Amid many of my programmes
I got a chance to meet some wonderful personalities
I want to discuss about them with you in 'Mann Ki Baat'
Though they belong to Japan
they harbour amazing attachment
love for India
One of them is Hiroshi Koike ji
who is a well-known Art Director
You will be very happy to know that he has directed the Mahabharat Project
This project was started in Cambodia
it is continuing for the last 9 years
Hiroshi Koike ji performs every task in a very different way
Every year
he travels to one country in Asia
produces parts of the Mahabharata with local artists
musicians there
Through this project
he has done productions
given stage performances in nine countries including India
Cambodia
Indonesia
Hiroshi Koike-ji brings together artists who have had a diverse background in Classical
Traditional Asian Performing Art
Because of that
different hues are seen in his work
Performers from Indonesia
Thailand
Malaysia
Japan make it more attractive through Java dance
Balinese dance
Thai dance
The special thing is that in this each performer speaks in his own mother tongue
the choreography very beautifully displays this diversity
the diversity of music makes this production more lively
Their aim is to bring to the fore the importance of Diversity
Co-existence in our society
what peace should really be like
Besides them
the other two people I met in Japan are Atsushi Matsuo-ji
Kenji Yoshi-ji
Both of them are associated with TEM Production Company
This company is associated with the Japanese Animation Film based on Ramayana that was released in 1993
This project was associated with Japan's very famous film director Yugo Sako Ji
About 40 years ago
in 1983
he came to know about Ramayana for the first time
'Ramayana' touched his heart
after which he started researching deeply on it
Not only that
he read 10 versions of Ramayana in Japanese language
and not only did he stop at this
he also wanted to showcase it through animation
In this
Indian animators also helped him a lot
he was guided about the Indian customs
traditions shown in the film
He was told how people in India wear the dhoti
how they wear the saree
how they groom their hair… How children respect each other within the family
what the tradition of blessing is! Waking up in the morning
offering salutation to the elders of the household
seeking their blessings - all these things! Now
after 30 years this animation film is being re-mastered in 4K
This project is likely to be completed soon
People living thousands of kilometers away from us in Japan
who don't know our language
who don't know much about our traditions
their dedication to our culture
this reverence
this respect
is very commendable - which Indian would not be proud of that!
My dear countrymen
the mantra of serving the society by rising above the self
is a part of our values
our sanskar
Countless people in our country are making this mantra their life goal
I came to know about Ram Bhupal Reddy ji
a friend living in Markapuram
Andhra Pradesh
You will be surprised to know that Ram Bhupal Reddy ji has donated all his earnings after retirement for the education of daughters
He got accounts opened for about 100 daughters under 'Sukanya Samridhi Yojana'
and deposited more than 25 lakhs in it
Another example of such service is of Kachora village of Agra in U.P
There was a shortage of fresh water in this village for many years
Meanwhile
Kunwar Singh
a farmer of the village found water in his field 6-7 km away from the village
It was a matter of great joy for him
He thought… why not serve all the other villagers too with this water! But
30-32 lakh rupees were needed to transport the water from the farm to the village
After some time
Kunwar Singh's younger brother Shyam Singh came to the village after retiring from the army
and he came to know about it
He handed over all his money received on retirement for this work
by laying a pipeline from the farm to the village; he supplied fresh water to the villagers
If there is dedication
seriousness towards one's duties
how even a single person can change the future of the whole society
this endeavor is a big inspiration
Only by walking on the path of duty can we empower the society; empower the country
In this Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav'
this should be our resolution
this should also be our sadhana….which has only one path - duty
duty
duty.
My dear countrymen
today in 'Mann Ki Baat' we discussed many important topics related to society
All of you send important suggestions related to different topics to me
and on the basis of them our discussion moves forward
Don't forget to send your suggestions for the next edition of 'Mann Ki Baat'
At present
the ongoing programs related to the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav; the events in which you are participating… do let me know about them
I look forward to your suggestions on Namo app
MyGov
Next time we will meet once again… we will again talk on similar topics related to our countrymen
Take care of yourself
also take care of all the living being around you
In this summer season
you should continue to fulfill your humane responsibility of providing food
water for the animals
birds…Do remember this
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen
Namaskar
 Today
'Chhath'
the great festival of sun worship is being celebrated in many parts of the country
Lakhs of devotees have reached their villages
their homes
their families to be a part of the 'Chhath' festival
I pray that Chhath Maiya bless everyone with prosperity
well being.
Friends
the tradition of worshiping the Sun is a proof of how deep our culture
our faith
is related to nature
Through this puja the importance of sunlight in our life has been illustrated
Along with this
the message has also been conveyed that ups
downs are an integral part of life
Therefore
we should maintain a uniform poise have in every situation
Various fruits
Thekua are offered in the worship of Chhath Maiya
The fasting in this is also not less than any difficult sadhna
Another special thing about Chhath Puja is that the items used for worship are prepared by myriad people of the society together
In this
a basket or supli made of bamboo is used
Earthen lamps have their own significance
Through this
the importance of farmers who grow gram
small entrepreneurs making batashas has been established in the society
Without their cooperation
the worship of Chhath
simply cannot be completed
The festival of Chhath also emphasizes on the importance of cleanliness in our lives
On the arrival of this festival
roads
rivers
ghats
various sources of water
all are cleaned at the community level
The festival of Chhath is also an example of 'Ek Bharat- Shrestha Bharat'
Today
wherever the people of Bihar
Purvanchal are in any corner of the country
Chhath is being celebrated with great pomp
Chhath is now getting organized on a large scale in different districts of Maharashtra along with Delhi
Mumbai
many parts of Gujarat
I do remember that earlier in Gujarat
Chhath Pooja was not performed to this extent.But with the passage of time
the colors of Chhath Puja have started getting dissolved in almost the whole of Gujarat
I am also very happy to see this
Nowadays we see
how many grand pictures of Chhath Puja come from abroad too
That is
the rich heritage of India
our faith
is re-inforcing its identity in every corner of the world
My best wishes to every devotee who is participating in this great festival.
My dear countrymen
we have just talked about the holy Chhath Puja
the worship of Lord Surya
So today
along with worshiping the Sun
why not also discuss his boon! This blessing of Sun God is - 'Solar Energy'
Solar Energy is a subject today
in which the whole world is looking at its future
for India
the Sun God has not only been worshiped for centuries
but has also been the focus of our way of life
Today
India is combining its traditional experiences with modern science
that is why
today
we have become one of the largest countries to generate electricity from solar energy
How solar energy is changing the lives of the poor
middle class of our country is also a subject of study.
In Tamil Nadu
there is a farmer in Kancheepuram
Thiru K
Ezilon
He took the benefit of 'PM Kusum Yojana'
got a solar pumpset of ten horsepower installed in his farm
Now they do not have to spend anything on electricity for their farm
They are not even dependent on the government's electricity supply for irrigation in the field any more
Similarly
in Bharatpur
Rajasthan
another beneficiary farmer of 'KusumYojana' is – Kamalji Meena
Kamal ji installed a solar pump in the field
due to which his expenses have come down
Since the expense has come down
the income also has increased
Kamalji is also connecting many other small industries with solar electricity
There is timber work in their area
there are products made from cow dung
solar electricity is also being used in them.
They are also giving employment to 10-12 people
that is
the fragrance of Kamalji’s initiative that started with Kusum Yojana
has started reaching many people.
Friends
can you ever imagine that on using electricity for a month
instead of getting your electricity bill
you get paid for electricity ? Solar energy has also demonstrated that
A few days ago
you must have heard a lot about the country's first Solar Village - Modhera of Gujarat! Most of the houses in Modhera Surya Gram have started generating electricity from solar power
Now in many houses there
there is no electricity bill at the end of the month; instead
a check from the electricity income is being generated
Seeing this happen
now people of many villages of the country are writing letters to me stating that their village should also be converted into Surya Gram
that is
the day is not far when the construction of Suryagrams in India will become a big mass movement
the people of Modhera village have already begun that.
Let us also introduce the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' to the people of Modhera
Shriman Vipinbhai Patel is at the moment with us on the phone line.
Prime Minister :- Look
now Modhera is being discussed as a model for the whole country
But when all your relatives
acquaintances ask you
what do you tell them
what have the benefits been?
Vipinji :- Sir
when people ask us
we say that whatever bill we used to get
that is now zero
sometimes it comes to 70 rupees
but the economic condition in our entire village is improving.
Prime Minister :- That is
in a way
the earlier concern of electricity bill is over!
Vipinji :- Yes sir
that is correct sir
Now there is no tension in the whole village
Everyone is feeling that what Sir has done
he has done very well
Everyone is happy Sir
All are delighted.
Prime Minister: - Now they themselves have become the owners of the electricity factory in their own houses
Electricity is being generated on the roof of their own houses.
Vipinji :- Yes sir
it is right sir.
Prime Minister :- So what is the effect of this change on the people of the village?
Vipinji:- Sir
the people of the whole village
they are into agriculture
so we have got rid of electricity hassles
No electricity bill is not to be paid
they have become free of worries.
Prime Minister :- Meaning
the electricity bill has also gone
the convenience has increased.
Vipinji :- The hassles are over Sir
Sir
when you had come here
that 3D show which you inaugurated here
after that  the glory of  Modhera village has grown manifold
And the secretary who had come sir...
Prime Minister :- Yes sir...
Vipinji :- So the village became famous sir.
Prime Minister :- Yes
it was the wish of the Secretary General of the UN himself
He urged me a lot that you  have done such a great work
so I want to go there
see.
Prime Minister :- Fine
Vipin Bhai
I wish you
all the people of your village many best wishes
the world should take inspiration from you
this solar energy campaign should reach every home.
Vipinji :- Alright sir
We will tell all of them Sir
to get solar installed
even with your own money,..
even then
there is a lot of benefit.
Prime Minister :- Yes
make the people understand
Wish you the very best
Thanks brother!
Vipinji :- Thank you sir
Thank you sir
my life feels blessed
talking to you.
Prime Minister :- Many thanks to Vipinbhai.
Let us now also talk to Varsha Behen in Modhera village.
Varshaben :- Hello! Namaste sir!
Prime Minister :- Namaste-Namaste Varshaben | how are you
Varshaben :- We are very good sir
How are you ?
Prime Minister :- I am very fine.
Varshaben :- We are blessed to talk to you sir.
Prime Minister :- Okay  Varshaben !
Varshaben :- Yes.
Prime Minister:- You are in Modhera...
you are from a military family.
Varshaben :- I am from military family
This is an ex Army man's wife speaking sir.
Prime Minister :- So where all did you get a chance to go in India earlier?
Varshaben :- I got a chance to stay together in Rajasthan
in Gandhi Nagar
Kachra Kanjhor in Jammu
There were a lot of facilities available there sir.
Prime Minister :- Yes
Being part of the army
you are also speaking Hindi well.
Varshaben :- Yes-yes
I have learned.
Prime Minister :- Tell me
the big transformation that came in Modhera
you got this Solar Rooftop Plant installed
What people might be saying in the beginning
then it must have come to your mind
what that meant? What are you doing ?what will happen ? How can electricity come this way?  These are all things that must have come to your mind
What is your experience now? What is the benefit of this?
Varshaben:- A lot sir
One benefit after the other sir
Sir
Diwali is celebrated every day in our village because of you
We are getting electricity for 24 hours a day...
there is no bill at all!  In our house we have brought all electric appliances in the house sir
we are using everything - because of you sir
Since
there is no bill
we can use everything with free mind.
Prime Minister :- This is true
you have also made up your mind to make maximum use of electricity.
Varshaben :- Indeed Sir! Right now we do not have any problem
we can run all this..
washing machine
AC
everything with a free mind
sir!
Prime Minister :- And the rest of the people of the village are also happy because of this?
Varshaben :- Very very happy sir.
Prime Minister:- Well
does your husband work at the Sun Temple there? So the light show that happened there was such a big event
now guests from all over the world are coming.
VarshaBen :- Foreigners from all over the world can come but you have made our village famous in the world.
Prime Minister :- So your husband’s work must have increased now that so many guests are coming there to see the temple.
VarshaBen :- Oh! It doesn't matter
no matter how much work increases sir
my husband has no problem with that...do go on developing our village.
Prime Minister :- Now we all have to do the development of the village together.
VarshaBen :- Yes
yes
Sir we are with you
Prime Minister :- And I would like to congratulate the people of Modhera because the village accepted this scheme
they were convinced that yes we can make electricity in our house.
Rain Ben -: 24 Hours Sir! We have electricity in our house
we are very happy.
Prime Minister :- Fine! I wish you the very best
The money that is saved
use it for the betterment of the children
Use that money well so that your life benefits
I wish you the very best
And my salutations to all the people of Modhera!
Friends
what Varshaben
Bipin Bhai have mentioned is an inspiration for the whole country
for villages
cities
Modhera's experience can be replicated across the country
The power of the sun will now save money
increase income
Manzoor Ahmed Larhwal is a friend from Srinagar
Jammu
Kashmir
 On account of winters in Kashmir
the cost of electricity is high
For this reason
Manzoorji's electricity bill also used to be more than Rs
4 thousand
but
since Manzoorji has got a Solar Rooftop Plant installed at his house
his expenditure has come down to less than half
Similarly
KunniDeori
a daughter from Odisha
is making solar energy a medium of employment for her as well as for other women
Kunni lives in Kardapal village of Kendujhar district of Odisha
She trains tribal women to spin silk on a solar-powered reeling machine
Due to the Solar Machine
these tribal women do not have to bear the burden of electricity bill
and they are earning income
This is the very boon of Sun God's solar energy
The more the boon
the blessings spread
the better it is
Therefore
I urge  you to join this
add others too.
My dear countrymen
just now I was talking to you about the sun
Now my attention is going towards space
That is because our country is doing wonders in the solar sector as well as the space sector
The whole world
today
is surprised to see the achievements of India
So I thought
by telling this to the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat'
I should make them happy too.
Friends
you must have seen a few days ago
that India has placed 36 satellites in space simultaneously
This success achieved just a day before Diwali
in a way
it is a special Diwali gift from our youth to the country
With this launching
from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
from Kutch to Kohima
in the whole country
digital connectivity will be further strengthened
With the help of this
even the remotest areas will be more easily connected with the rest of the country
When the country is self-reliant
how
it reaches new heights of success - this is also an example of this
While talking to you
I also remember thos old days
when India was denied the Cryogenic Rocket Technology
But the scientists of India not only developed indigenous technology
but today with the help of it
dozens of satellites are being sent to space simultaneously
With this launching
India has emerged as a strong player in the global commercial market...with this
new doors of oppurtunities have also opened up for India.
Friends
our country
which is moving with the resolve of a developed India
can achieve its goals only with the efforts of everyone
Earlier in India
the space sector was confined within the purview of government systems
Since
the space sector was opened for India’s youth
revolutionary changes have started coming in it
Indian industries
start-ups are engaged in bringing new innovations
new technologies in this field
In particular
the collaboration of IN-SPACe is going to make a big difference in this area.
Non-government companies are also getting the facility to launch their payloads
satellites through IN-SPACe
I would urge more
more Start-ups
Innovators to take full advantage of these huge opportunities being created in India in the space sector.
My dear countrymen
when it comes to students
youth power
leadership power
so many outdated stereotypes have become ingrained in our mind
Many times we see that when student power is referred to
its scope is limited by linking it with the student union elections
But the scope of student power is very big
very vast
Student power is the basis of making India powerful
After all
it’s the youth of today
who will take are today will take India till 2047
When India celebrates her centenary
this power of youth
their hard work
their sweat
their talent
will take India to the heights that the country is resolving today
The way our youth of today are working for the country
and have joined nation building
makes me filled with confidence
The way our youth solve problems in hackathons
stay awake all night
work for hours
is very inspiring
A hackathon held in recent years
with lakhs of youth of the country
together have solved many challenges; have given new solutions to the country.
Friends
you may remember
I had called for 'Jai Anusandhan' from the Red Fort
I had also talked about making this decade the Techade of India
I loved seeing this; our IIT's students have also taken over its command
This month on 14-15 October
all 23 IITs came on one platform for the first time to showcase their innovations
research projects
In this fair
students
researchers who came from all over the country
displayed more than 75 best projects
Healthcare
Agriculture
Robotics
Semiconductors
5G Communications
these projects were made on many such themes
Although all these projects were one better than the other
I want to draw your attention to some projects
For example
a team from IIT Bhubaneswar has developed a portable ventilator for newborn babies
It runs on battery
can be used easily in remote areas
This can prove to be very helpful in saving the lives of babies who are born prematurely
Be it electric mobility
drone technology
5G
many of our students are engaged in developing new technology related to them
Several IITs are also working together on a multilingual project that makes learning local languages easier.
This project will help the new National Education Policy a lot in achieving those goals as well
You will also be happy to know that IIT Madras
IIT Kanpur have played a leading role in preparing India's indigenous 5G testbed
This is certainly a great start
I hope to see many more such efforts in the times to come
I also hope that taking inspiration from IITs
other institutions will also step up their R&D activities

My dear countrymen
sensitivity towards the environment is embedded in every particle of our society
we can feel it all around us
There is no dearth of people in the country who spend a lifetime in the protection of the environment.
We can also learn a lot from Suresh Kumar ji
who lives in Bangaluru
Karnataka
he has a great passion for protecting nature
environment
20 years ago
he had taken the initiative to rejuvenate a forest of Sahakarnagar in the city
It was a difficult task
But these saplings that were planted 20 years ago have grown into 40 feet tall huge trees
Now their beauty captivates everyone's mind
This also gives a feeling of great pride to the people living there
Suresh Kumar ji also does anohter wonderful job
He has also built a bus shelter in Sahakarnagar to promote Kannada language
culture
He has also presented brass plates written in Kannada to hundreds of people
If both Ecology
Culture grow together
flourish...
just imagine how great it would be!
Friends
today more awareness is being seen among people about Eco-friendly living
Eco-friendly products than ever before
I also got a chance to know about one such interesting endeavor from Tamil Nadu
This is a brilliant effort by a team of tribal women in Anaikatti
Coimbatore
These women crafted ten thousand Eco-friendly Terracotta Tea Cups for export
The amazing thing is that these women themselves took up the entire responsibility of making the Terracotta Tea Cups
From Clay Mixing to Final Packaging
they did all the work themselves
They had also taken training for this
Whatever praise is showered onthis wonderful effort is little.
Friends
some villages of Tripura have also set very good examples
You must have heard about Bio-Village
but some villages of Tripura have ascended to the level of Bio-Village 2
Bio-Village 2 emphasizes how to minimize the damage caused by natural disasters
In this
full attention is given to improve the quality of life of the people through various measures
There is complete focus on Solar Energy
Biogas
Bee Keeping
Bio Fertilizers
Overall
Bio-Village 2 is going to lend a lot of strength to the campaign against climate change
I am very happy to see the increasing enthusiasm for environmental protection in different parts of the country
A few days ago
in India
Mission Life dedicated to protect the environment has also been launched
The simple principle of Mission Life is - Promote such a lifestyle
which does not harm the environment
I urge you to also know Mission Life
try to adopt it.
Friends
Tomorrow
the 31st of October
is National Unity Day
the auspicious occasion of the birth anniversary of SardarVallabhbhai Patel
On this day
Run for Unity is organized in every corner of the country
This race strengthens the thread of unity in the country
inspires our youth
A few days ago
the same sentiment has been seen during our National Games as well
With the theme 'Judega India to Jeetega India'
national game
on the one hand
have given a strong message of unity
on the other 
have promoted India's sports culture
You will be happy to know that the National Games this time was the biggest ever organized in India
36 sports were included in this
in which
7 new
two indigenous competitions
Yogasan
Mallakhamb were also included
The three teams that were at the fore in winning the Gold Medal are - Services team
Maharashtra
Haryana team
Six National Records
about 60 National Games Records were also made in these games
I congratulate all the players
who won medals
made new records
participated in this sports competition
I also wish these players a bright future.
Friends
I would also like to express my heartfelt appreciation to all those people who contributed in the successful organization of the National Games held in Gujarat
You have seen that in Gujarat the National Games were held during Navratri
Before organizing these games
once it came to my mind that at this time the whole of Gujarat is involved in these festivals
so how will people be able to enjoy these games? Such elaborate arrangement
on the other hand
arrangements for Navratri Garba etc!
How will Gujarat do all this work at the same time? But the people of Gujarat made all the guests happy with their hospitality
The way art
sports
culture came together during the National Games in Ahmedabad
it filled all with joy
While the players also used to participate in the games during the day; in the evening they used to get immersed in the colors of Garba
Dandiya
They also shared a lot of pictures of Gujarati food
Navratri on social media
It was a pleasure for all of us to see
After all
through games like these
one comes to know about the diverse cultures of India
They equally strengthen the spirit of 'Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
My dear countrymen
on the 15th of November
our country will celebrate the Janjateeya Gaurav Diwas
You will remember
the country started this last year to celebrate the tribal heritage
pride on the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda
Bahgwan BirsaMunda had united millions of people against the British rule in his short lifetime
He had sacrificed his life to protect India's independence
tribal culture
There is so much that we can learn from Dharti Aba Birsa Munda
Friends
when it comes to Dharti Aba Birsa Munda
let's look at his short life span; even today we can learn a lot from him
Dharti Aba had said- ‘This earth is ours
we are its protectors.’  There is also a sense of duty for the motherland in this sentence
there is also a feeling of our duty for the environment
He had always emphasized that we should not forget our tribal culture
we should not go far from it at all
Even today
we can learn a lot about nature
environment from the tribal societies of the country.
Friends
Last year on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda
I had the privilege of inaugurating the Bhagwan Birsa Munda Museum in Ranchi
I would like to urge the youth that whenever they get time
they must visit it
I also want to tell you that on November 1
i.e
the day after tomorrow
I shall be at will be at Mangarh
on the border of Gujarat-Rajasthan
Mangarh has had a very special place in India's freedom struggle
our rich tribal heritage
There was a terrible massacre here in November 1913
in which the British brutally murdered the local tribals
It is said that more than a thousand tribals lost their lives in this massacre
This tribal movement was led by Govind Guru ji
whose life is an inspiration to everyone
Today I bow to all those tribal martyrs
the indomitable courage
valor of Govind Guru ji
The more faithfully we follow the ideals of Bhagwan Birsa Munda
Govind Guru
other freedom fighters during Amrit Kaal
the more our country will touch newer  heights.
My dear countrymen
the  8th of Novembe is Gurupurab
As much as the Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak ji is important for our faith
we equally get to learn from it
Throughout his life
Guru Nanak Dev Ji spread light for the sake of humanity
In the last few years
the country has made many efforts to spread the light of Gurus to the masses
We had the privilege of celebrating the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak DevJi on a large scale in the country
abroad
It is equally pleasant to see the development of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor after decades of waiting
A few days ago I also got the privilege of laying the foundation stone of the ropeway for Hemkund Sahib
We have to continuously learn from the teachings of our Gurus
remain devoted to them
This day is also  Kartik Purnima
On this day
at places of piligrimages
we bathe
perform service
charity
I extend warm greetings to all of you on these festivals
In the coming days
many states will also celebrate their Statehood day
Andhra Pradesh will celebrate its foundation day; Kerala Piravi will be celebrated
Karnataka Rajyotsava will be celebrated
Similarly
Madhya Pradesh
Chhattisgarh
Haryana will also celebrate their Statehood day
I convey my best wishes to the people of all these states
In all our states
the stronger the spirit to learn from each other
to cooperate
and to work together
the more the country will go forward
I am sure we will move forward with the same spirit
You all take care of yourself
stay healthy
I take leave of you till the next episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'
Namaskar
thanks.
My dear countrymen
Namaskar!
The topic that grabbed our attention in the last few days is the Cheetah
There have been a lot of messages to talk about cheetahs
Be it Arun Kumar Gupta of Uttar Pradesh or N
Ramachandran Raghuram ji of Telangana
be it Rajan ji of Gujarat or Subrata ji of Delhi
people from all corners of the country have expressed happiness over the return of cheetahs to India
130 crore Indians are happy
full of pride; this is India's love for nature
A common question posed by people about this is “Modi ji
when will we get an opportunity to see the cheetahs?”
Friends
a task force have been formed
This task force will monitor the cheetahs
see how much they have been able to adapt to the environment here
On this basis a decision will be taken after a few months
then you will be able to see the cheetahs
But till then I am assigning some work to all of you
For this
a competition will be organized on the MyGov platform
in which I urge people to share certain things
What should be the name of the campaign that we are running on cheetahs? Can we even think of naming all these cheetahs…
by what name should each of them be called? By the way
if this naming is of traditional nature
then it will be very nice since
anything related to our society
culture
tradition
heritage
draws us easily
Not only that
you should also share how humans should behave with animals! Even in our fundamental duties
emphasis has been laid on Respect for Animals
I appeal to all of you to participate in this competition
Who knows…you may be the first to get an opportunity to see a cheetah as a reward!
My dear countrymen
today the 25th of September is celebrated as the birthday of Deendayal Upadhyay ji
the brilliant humanist
thinker
great son of the country
The more the youth of any country take pride in their identity
honour
the more their original ideas
philosophies attract them
The biggest feature of Deendayal ji's thoughts is that in his lifetime
he had seen the great upheavals of the world
He had become a witness to the struggles of ideologies
That is why
he put forward an idea of 'Ekatma Manavdarshan'
'Antyodaya' before the country which was completely Indian
Deendayal ji's 'Ekatma Manavdarshan' is such an idea
which in the realm of ideology gives freedom from conflict
prejudice
He again put forth to the world
the Indian philosophy which considers human beings equal
It has been said in our scriptures – 'Atmavat Sarvabhuteshu'
that is
we should treat living beings akin to us
similarly treat them such
Deendayal ji taught us how Indian philosophy can guide the world even in the modern
social
political perspective
In a way
he awakened our intellectual consciousness by freeing us from the inferiority complex that prevailed in the country after independence
He also used to say - 'Our freedom can be meaningful only when it expresses our culture
identity'
On the basis of this idea
he had created a vision for the development of the country
Deendayal Upadhyay ji used to say that the measure of the progress of the country is the person at the lowest step
In the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav
the more we know Deendayal ji
the more we learn from him
the more we will get inspiration to take the country forward.
My dear countrymen
three days later
that is
on the 28th of September
is a special day of Amrit Mahotsav
On this day we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Bhagat Singh ji
the brave son of Mother India
Just before the birth anniversary of Bhagat Singh
an important decision has been taken as a tribute to him
It has been decided that the Chandigarh airport will now be named after Shaheed Bhagat Singh
It had been in the waiting for a long time
I congratulate the people of Chandigarh
Punjab
and Haryana
of the entire country for this decision.
Friends
let us take inspiration from our freedom fighters
following their ideals
build the India of their dreams… this is our tribute to them
The memorials of martyrs
the names of places
institutions named after them inspire us with a sense of duty
Just a few days ago
the country has made a similar effort by setting up the statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on Kartavya Path
now the name of Chandigarh Airport after Shaheed Bhagat Singh is another step in that direction
I wish
the way in which we are celebrating special occasions related to freedom fighters during the Amrit Mahotsav
in the same way every youth must try something new on the 28th of September.
By the way
my dear countrymen
all of you have another reason to celebrate the 28th of September
Do you know what it is? I will say only two words
I know your enthusiasm will increase fourfold.
These two words are - Surgical Strike!
Hasn’t the Josh risen!! Let us celebrate the campaign of the ongoing Amrit Mahotsav in our country with full enthusiasm
sharing our happiness with everyone.
My dear countrymen
it is said - no obstacle can stand in the way of a person who has been forged by the struggles of life
In our everyday life
we also see some friends who are coping with some physical challenge or the other
There are many people who are either unable to hear
or are unable to express themselves through speech
The biggest support for such friends is Sign Language
But a big problem in India for years was that there were no clear gestures
no standards for Sign Language
To overcome these difficulties
the Indian Sign Language Research
Training Center was established in the year 2015
I am happy that this institution has thus far prepared a dictionary comprising ten thousand words
expressions
Two days ago i.e
on the 23rd of September
on the Sign Language Day
many school courses have also been launched in Sign Language
A lot of emphasis has also been given in the National Education Policy to maintain a fixed standard for Sign Language
It is being further disseminated
even by making videos of the dictionary of Sign Language
On YouTube
many people
many institutions
have started their channels in Indian Sign Language
that is
the campaign that started in the country about Sign Language 7-8 years ago
is benefitting millions of my specially-abled brothers
sisters now
Pooja ji
who hails from Haryana
is very happy with the Indian Sign Language
Earlier she was not able to communicate with her son
but after going through Sign Language training in 2018
the lives of both mother
son have become easier
Pooja ji's son also learned Sign Language
in his school he won a prize in storytelling as well
Similarly
Tinkaji has a six-year-old daughter who cannot hear
Tinkaji had made her daughter undergo a Sign Language course but she herself did not know Sign Language
and hence she could not communicate with her daughter
Now Tinkaji has also undergone sign language training
thus both mother
daughter now converse a lot among themselves
Manju ji of Kerala has also benefited a lot from these efforts
Manju ji is not able to hear since birth
Not only that
this has been the situation in the lives of her parents as well
In such a situation
sign language has become a means of communication for the whole family
Now Manju ji herself has decided to become a Sign Language teacher.
Friends
I am also discussing about this in 'Mann Ki Baat' so that the awareness about Indian Sign Language increases
With this
we will be able to help our specially-abled friends more
more
Brothers
sisters
a few days ago
I got a copy of the Hemkosh too written in Braille
Hemkosh is one of the oldest dictionaries of Assamese language
It was prepared in the 19th century
It was edited by eminent linguist Hemchandra Barua ji
The Braille Edition of Hemkosh is around 10,000 pages long
is going to be published in more than 15 volumes
In this
more than 1 lakh words have to be translated
I greatly appreciate this sensitive effort
Every such effort goes a long way in increasing the skill
capability of our specially-abled friends
Today India is also raising the flag of success in Para Sports
We have all been witness to this in many tournaments
Today there are many people who are engaged in promoting the fitness culture among the specially-abled at the grassroots level
This imparts a lot of strength to the self-confidence of the specially-abled.
My dear countrymen
a few days ago
I just met a girl from Surat
Anvi
My meeting with Anvi
Anvi's yoga has been so memorable that I want to tell all the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' about it
Friends
Anvi is afflicted with Down’s Syndrome since birth
she has also been battling with serious heart disease since childhood
She also had to undergo open heart surgery when she was only three months old
Despite all these difficulties
neither Anvi
nor her parents ever gave up
Anvi's parents gathered all the information about Down’s syndrome
then decided on the way to reduce Anvi's dependence on others
They started teaching Anvi how to lift a glass of water
how to tie shoe laces
how to button clothes; small things such as those
What the appropriate place of things is
what the good habits are
they tried to teach Anvi all this with a lot of patience
The way daughter Anvi showed her will to learn
displayed her talent
her parents also got a lot of encouragement
They inspired Anvi to learn yoga
The problem was so serious
that Anvi could not even stand on her own two feet…In such a situation
her parents inspired Anvi to learn yoga
When she went to the Yoga coach for the first time
the coach too was in a dilemma whether this innocent girl would be able to do yoga! But even the coach probably had no idea of what stuff Anvi was made of
She started practicing yoga with her mother
now she has become an expert in yoga
Today Anvi participates in competitions across the country
wins medals
Yoga gave a new life to Anvi
Anvi assimilated yoga
imbibed life
Anvi's parents told me that yoga has brought amazing changes in Anvi's life… Now her self-confidence has become remarkable
Yoga has also improved Anvi's physical health
the need for medicines is also lessening
I would like that the listeners of 'Mann Ki Baat' in the country
abroad do a scientific study of the benefits of yoga to Anvi
I think Anvi is a good case study
for those who want to test the power of yoga
Such scientists should come forward with studies based on Anvi’s success
introduce the world to the power of yoga
Any such research could be of great help to children afflicted with Down’s syndrome around the world
Now
the world has accepted that yoga is very effective for physical
mental wellness
Especially in problems related to diabetes
blood pressure
yoga helps a lot
In view of such power of yoga
the United Nations had decided to celebrate the International Yoga Day on the 21st of June
Now
United Nations has recognized
honored another effort of India
This is an effort
started in the year 2017 – the “India Hypertension Control Initiative”
Under this
lakhs of people suffering from blood pressure problems are being treated in government wellness centers
The way this initiative has attracted the attention of international organizations is unprecedented
It is a matter of encouragement for all of us that out of those who have been treated
about half of them are having their blood pressure under control
I congratulate all the people working for this initiative
who made it a success with their untiring hard work.
Friends
the evolutionary journey of human life has been continuously connected with water - be it seas
rivers or ponds
India is also fortunate that due to the long coastline of more than seven
a half thousand kilometers (7500 km)
our bond with the sea has remained unbroken
This coastal border passes through many states
islands
India's culture
full of different communities
diversity can be seen flourishing here
Not only that
the cuisine of these coastal areas attracts a lot of people
But along with these interesting things
there is also a sad side
These coastal areas of ours are facing many environmental challenges
Climate Change remains a major threat to Marine Eco-Systems
On the other hand
the litter spread on our beaches is disturbing
It becomes our responsibility to make serious
continuous efforts for these challenges
Here I would like to talk about an effort of Coastal Cleaning in the coastal areas of the country 'Swachh Sagar - Surakshit Sagar'
This campaign
which started on the 5th of July culminated on the 17thof September
the day of Vishwakarma Jayanti
This day was also Coastal Clean Up Day
This campaign which started in the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav lasted for 75 days
Public participation in this was a sight to behold
During this effort
many cleanliness related programs were seen for the entire two
a half months
A long human chain was made in Goa
During the Ganpati immersion in Kakinada
people were told about the harm caused by plastic
About 5000 young friends from the NSS collected more than 30 tonnes of plastic
Within three days in Odisha
more than 20 thousand school students took a pledge that they would inspire their family
people along with them as well
for the Swachh Sagar – Surakshit Sagar initiative
I would like to congratulate all the people who took part in this campaign.
When I interact with Elected Officials
especially the mayors of cities
sarpanches of villages
I urge them to include Local Communities
Local Organizations in efforts like cleanliness as well as adopt innovative methods.
There is a team in Bangalore - Youth for Parivartan
For the last eight years
this team has been working on cleanliness
other community activities
Their motto is very clear – 'Stop Complaining
Start Acting'
This team has so far beautified more than 370 places across the city
The campaign of Youth for Parivartan has connected 100 to 150 (150) citizens at every place
Every Sunday this program starts in the morning
continues till noon
In this task
not only is the garbage lifted
the work of painting the walls
making artistic sketches is also done
At many places
you can also see sketches of famous people
inspirational quotes by them
Following upon the efforts of Youth For Parivartan of Bangalore
I would also like to tell you about the 'Kabaad se Jugaad' campaign of Meerut
This campaign is related to the protection of the environment as well as the beautification of the city
The special thing about this campaign is that
in this
waste such as iron scrap
plastic waste
old tires
drums are used
This campaign is also an example of how to beautify public places at a low cost
I appreciate all the people involved in this campaign from the core of my heart.
My dear countrymen
at this time there is a festive spirit all around the country
Tomorrow is the first day of Navaratri
In this
we will worship the first avatar of Goddess 'Maa Shailputri'
From here
there will be nine days of self discipline
restraint
fasting
then there will also be the festival of Vijayadashami
That is
if we look at it in a way
we will find that along with faith
spirituality
how a profound message is hidden in our festivals
The attainment of ‘Siddhi’ through discipline
restraint
and then the festival of victory
that’s the way to achieve any goal in life
After Dussehra
the festival of Dhanteras
Diwali will follow.
Friends
during the past years
a new resolution of the country has also been associated with our festivals
You all know
this is the resolution of 'Vocal for Local'
We now include our local artisans
craftsmen
traders in the joy of festivals
On the occasion of Bapu's birth anniversary on the 2nd of October
we have to take a pledge to intensify this campaign
Khadi
handloom
handicrafts…along with all these products
you must buy local goods
After all
the true joy of this festival is also when everyone becomes a part of it
Therefore
people associated with the work of local products also have to be supported by us
A good way is to include these type of products in whatever gifts we give during the festival.
At this time
this campaign is also special because during the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav
we are also onwards with the goal of a self-reliant India
Which
in the real sense
will be a true tribute to the freedom fighters
That's why I request you to break all the records this time to buy these products of Khadi
handloom or handicrafts
We have seen that polythene bags are also being used a lot for packing
packaging during festivals
The harmful litter of polythene on the festivals observing cleanliness is also against the spirit of our festivals
Therefore
we should use only locally made non-plastic bags
The trend of jute
cotton
banana fibre
many such traditional bags is on the rise once again
It is our duty to promote them on the occasion of festivals
and take care of our health
environment along with cleanliness.
My dear countrymen
it is said in our scriptures –
'Parhit Saris Dharam Nahi Bhai'
That is
there is no other Dharma like doing good to others
serving others
doing charity
Recently
in the country
another glimpse of this spirit of social service was seen
You must have also seen that people are coming forward
are adopting one TB patient or the other
taking the lead in ensuring a nutritious diet
Actually
it is a part of the TB Free India campaign
whose basis is public participation; a sense of duty
It is possible to cure TB with the right nutrition
with the right medicines at the right time
I believe that with this power of public participation
India will definitely be free from TB by the year 2025.
Friends
I have also come to know such an example from the Union Territories of Dadra-Nagar Haveli
Daman-Diu
which touches the heart
Jinu Rawatiya ji
who lives in a tribal area here
has written that under the ongoing village adoption program
students of the medical college have adopted 50 villages
It also includes the village of Jinu Ji
These medical students make the people of the village aware to avoid illness
also help in the recuperation
and also impart information about the schemes of the government
This spirit of philanthropy has brought new joy in the lives of the people living in the villages
I congratulate all the students of the medical college for this endeavor.
Friends,a variety of new topics are being discussed in 'Mann Ki Baat'
Many times
through this program
we get an opportunity to delve into the depth of some old subjects
Last month in 'Mann Ki Baat'
I discussed about coarse cereals
and celebrating the year 2023 as 'International Millet Year'
People are very curious about this topic
I have received many such letters in which people have written how they have made millets a part of their daily diet
Some people have also referred to traditional dishes made from millets
These are signs of a big change
Seeing this enthusiasm of people
I think that we should prepare an e-book together
in which people can share their experiences
dishes made from millets
so that
before the start of the International Millet Year
we will have a public encyclopedia based on millets which can be published on the MyGov portal.
Friends
that’s all this time in 'Mann Ki Baat'
but before I leave
I want to tell you about the National Games as well
National Games are being organized in Gujarat from the 29th of September
This is a very special occasion
because the National Games are being organized after many years
The previous events had to be canceled due to the Covid pandemic
My very best wishes to every player who takes part in this sports meet
To raise the enthusiasm of the players on this day
I will be in their midst
All of you must also follow the National Games
encourage our players
I now take leave of you
We will meet again next month with new topics in 'Mann Ki Baat'.
Dhanyavaad
Namaskar!
